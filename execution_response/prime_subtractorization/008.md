When solving the **$N$-subtractorization** problem, several key insights and optimizations are essential to handle the constraints efficiently:

1. **Prime Generation with Sieve of Eratosthenes:**
   - Given the upper limit \( N \leq 10^7 \), it's feasible to generate all prime numbers up to the maximum \( N \) across all test cases using the Sieve of Eratosthenes. This sieve efficiently identifies prime numbers by iteratively marking the multiples of each prime number starting from 2.

2. **Efficient Difference Calculation:**
   - For each prime \( d \) (which is a potential subtractorization), we need to determine if there exists at least one pair of primes \( (p', p'') \) such that \( d = p' - p'' \) and both \( p' \) and \( p'' \) are primes \( \leq N \).
   - Instead of checking all possible pairs (which would be computationally expensive), we iterate through each prime \( d \) and check if there exists a prime \( p'' \) such that \( p'' + d \) is also a prime within the range. This reduces the problem to a single loop with an inner search that can terminate early upon finding a valid pair.

3. **Utilizing Sets for Fast Lookup:**
   - By storing the primes in a set, we can achieve constant-time lookups to verify if a number is prime. This is crucial for quickly determining if \( p'' + d \) is a prime without iterating through the list of primes each time.

4. **Handling Multiple Test Cases Efficiently:**
   - Since there can be up to 100 test cases, it's optimal to generate the sieve once up to the maximum \( N \) across all test cases. This avoids redundant computations and leverages the precomputed sieve for each individual test case.

5. **Early Termination in Searches:**
   - When searching for a valid \( p'' \) for a given \( d \), the search can terminate as soon as a valid pair is found. This significantly reduces the number of iterations, especially for larger \( N \).

By incorporating these strategies, the solution efficiently computes the number of **$N$-subtractorizations** for each test case within the given constraints.
