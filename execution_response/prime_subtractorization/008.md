**Key Findings:**

1. **Prime Generation:** To efficiently solve the problem, we need to generate all prime numbers up to the maximum value of \( N \) across all test cases. The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an optimal algorithm for this purpose, especially given the constraint \( N \leq 10{,}000{,}000 \).

2. **Difference of Primes:** An \( N \)-subtractorization is a prime \( p \) that can be expressed as the difference \( p = q - r \), where both \( q \) and \( r \) are primes \( \leq N \). To identify such primes \( p \), we can iterate through each prime \( q \) and check if \( q - r \) is also prime for any prime \( r \leq q \).

3. **Optimized Counting:** To handle multiple test cases efficiently, especially with \( T \leq 100 \), it's beneficial to preprocess and store the counts of \( N \)-subtractorizations up to the maximum \( N \) encountered. This way, each test case can be answered in constant time by referencing the precomputed counts.

4. **Space and Time Considerations:** Given the large upper limit for \( N \), it's crucial to implement the sieve and counting mechanisms in a space-efficient manner. Utilizing bit arrays or optimized data structures can help manage memory usage effectively.

5. **Prefix Sum Technique:** By maintaining a prefix sum array of the counts of valid \( p \) values, we can quickly retrieve the number of \( N \)-subtractorizations for any given \( N \) without redundant computations.

**Python Code:**

```python
import sys
import threading

def main():
    import sys
    import math

    sys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)
    T_and_cases = sys.stdin.read().split()
    T = int(T_and_cases[0])
    Ns = list(map(int, T_and_cases[1:T+1]))
    max_N = max(Ns)

    # Sieve of Eratosthenes
    sieve = [True] * (max_N + 1)
    sieve[0:2] = [False, False]
    for i in range(2, int(math.isqrt(max_N)) + 1):
        if sieve[i]:
            sieve[i*i:max_N+1:i] = [False] * len(range(i*i, max_N+1, i))
    primes = [i for i, is_prime in enumerate(sieve) if is_prime]

    # Initialize a list to mark p's
    subtractorizations = [0] * (max_N + 1)

    # Use a set for O(1) lookup
    prime_set = set(primes)

    # Iterate through all primes q
    for q in primes:
        # Iterate through primes r where r <= q - 2
        # Because p = q - r >= 2
        for r in primes:
            if r > q - 2:
                break
            p = q - r
            if p > max_N:
                continue
            if sieve[p]:
                subtractorizations[p] = 1

    # Create prefix sum
    prefix = [0] * (max_N + 1)
    count = 0
    for i in range(2, max_N + 1):
        if subtractorizations[i]:
            count += 1
        prefix[i] = count

    # Answer each test case
    for idx, N in enumerate(Ns, 1):
        print(f"Case #{idx}: {prefix[N]}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    threading.Thread(target=main).start()
```

**Explanation of the Code:**

1. **Input Handling:** The code reads all input at once for efficiency, especially since \( T \) can be up to 100 and \( N \) up to \( 10^7 \).

2. **Sieve of Eratosthenes:** It generates all prime numbers up to the maximum \( N \) using the sieve method.

3. **Marking Subtractorizations:** For each prime \( q \), it iterates through primes \( r \) such that \( r \leq q - 2 \) to ensure \( p = q - r \geq 2 \). If \( p \) is also prime, it marks \( p \) as a valid subtractorization.

4. **Prefix Sum Array:** A prefix sum array is created to store the cumulative count of valid \( p \)'s up to each index \( i \). This allows for constant-time retrieval of results for each test case.

5. **Output:** Finally, for each test case, the code prints the number of \( N \)-subtractorizations using the precomputed prefix sum.

**Optimization Notes:**

- **Threading:** The use of threading with `threading.Thread(target=main).start()` helps in increasing the recursion limit and managing larger inputs efficiently.

- **Early Termination:** The inner loop breaks early (`if r > q - 2: break`) to reduce unnecessary iterations, enhancing performance.

- **Space Efficiency:** By using lists and sets judiciously, the code maintains a balance between speed and memory usage, ensuring it runs effectively within the given constraints.
