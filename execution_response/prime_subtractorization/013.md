**Key Findings:**

To solve the problem of counting *N-subtractorizations*, we need an efficient approach given the constraints:

1. **Prime Generation:** 
   - Utilize the Sieve of Eratosthenes to generate all prime numbers up to the maximum possible value of \( N \) (i.e., \( 10^7 \)). This sieve will allow for constant-time prime checks.

2. **Prime List Preparation:**
   - Create a list of all primes identified by the sieve. This list will be used to iterate through potential candidates for \( a \) and \( b \).

3. **Counting Subtractorizations:**
   - For each test case with a given \( N \):
     - Iterate through each prime \( p \) up to \( N \).
     - For each \( p \), check if there exists at least one prime \( b \) such that \( b \leq N - p \) and \( p + b \) is also a prime. If such a \( b \) exists, \( p \) is an *N-subtractorization*.
   - To optimize:
     - Use binary search to find the upper bound for \( b \) (i.e., primes \( \leq N - p \)).
     - Utilize the precomputed sieve for \( O(1) \) prime checks during the verification of \( p + b \).

4. **Performance Considerations:**
   - Precompute the sieve and prime list once, outside the test cases, to avoid redundant computations.
   - Employ efficient looping and searching mechanisms to handle up to \( 100 \) test cases with \( N \) as large as \( 10^7 \).

By following this approach, we ensure that the solution operates within acceptable time and space limits, even for the upper bounds of the input constraints.

            # b must be <= N - p
            # Find the index in primes where prime > N - p
            # All primes up to N - p are candidates for b
            # We can iterate through primes up to N - p and check if p + b is prime
            # To optimize, iterate through primes and break early
            # Since p + b must be prime and p + b <=N
            # We can iterate through b's primes <= N - p

            # if p + b is prime
            # To further optimize, iterate through b's starting from smallest prime
            # and break as soon as p + b > N

            # Iterate through a = p + b <= N, where b is prime and a is prime
            # So we can iterate through a's and see if a - p is prime and <= N
