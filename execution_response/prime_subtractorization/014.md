**Key Findings:**

To solve the problem of counting *N-subtractorizations*, we need to determine the number of prime numbers \( P \) that can be expressed as the difference of two primes \( Q \) and \( R \) (i.e., \( P = Q - R \)), where both \( Q \) and \( R \) are primes not exceeding \( N \).

Given the constraints:
- \( 1 \leq T \leq 100 \)
- \( 1 \leq N \leq 10,000,000 \)

A direct approach would be inefficient due to the large value of \( N \). Instead, we can adopt an optimized approach using the Sieve of Eratosthenes and NumPy's vectorization capabilities:

1. **Sieve of Eratosthenes:** 
   - Generate all prime numbers up to \( N_{\text{max}} = 10,000,000 \).

2. **Finding \( N \)-Subtractorizations:**
   - For each prime \( P \), find the smallest prime \( Q \) such that \( Q = P + R \) (with \( R \) also prime).
   - This ensures that \( P \) is a valid \( N \)-subtractorization for \( N \geq Q \).

3. **Efficient Counting:**
   - Use NumPy's `bincount` and `cumsum` to efficiently count the number of valid \( P \) values for each \( N \).
   - Precompute the counts for all possible \( N \) up to \( 10,000,000 \) to handle multiple test cases swiftly.

This approach ensures that the solution is both time and space-efficient, leveraging NumPy's optimized operations to handle large datasets effectively.
