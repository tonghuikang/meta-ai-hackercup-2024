To solve this problem efficiently, especially given the constraints \(1 \leq N \leq 10^7\), we need to avoid any methods that are \(O(N^2)\) or involve nested loops over all primes up to \(N\), as such computations would be too heavy given the time constraints.

**Key Findings:**

1. **Understanding N-subtractorizations**: 
   - An *\(N\)-subtractarization* is a prime \(p\) such that there exist prime numbers \(p_1\) and \(p_2\) (both at most \(N\)) satisfying \(p = p_1 - p_2\).
   - Observing the examples and sample outputs, we notice that the number of N-subtractorizations corresponds to the number of primes \(p \leq N\) for which \(N - p\) is also a prime.

2. **Simplifying the Problem**:
   - For a given \(N\), the number of N-subtractorizations can be computed by finding the number of primes \(p \leq N\) such that \(N - p\) is also a prime (and \(N - p \leq N\)).
   - This reduces the problem to iterating over all primes up to \(N\) and checking if \(N - p\) is also a prime.

3. **Implementation Strategy**:
   - Precompute all primes up to \(N_{\text{max}}\) using the Sieve of Eratosthenes.
   - For each \(N\) in the input cases, iterate over all primes \(p \leq N\) and check if \(N - p\) is also prime and \(N - p \leq N\).
   - To prevent double counting and ensure correctness, we only consider \(p \leq \frac{N}{2}\).

4. **Optimizations**:
   - Since the number of primes up to \(N\) is approximately \(\frac{N}{\log N}\), for \(N = 10^7\), it's about \(6 \times 10^5\). Thus, per test case, the operations are reasonable.
   - By precomputing the prime numbers up to \(N_{\text{max}}\) only once, we save on redundant computations across multiple test cases.

Here's the Python code implementing the above strategy:

```python
import sys
import threading

def main():
    T = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    N_list = [int(sys.stdin.readline()) for _ in range(T)]
    N_max = max(N_list)
    is_prime = [True] * (N_max + 1)
    is_prime[0] = is_prime[1] = False
    for i in range(2, int(N_max ** 0.5) + 1):
        if is_prime[i]:
            for j in range(i * i, N_max + 1, i):
                is_prime[j] = False
    primes = [i for i, val in enumerate(is_prime) if val]
    counts = [0] * (N_max + 1)
    for N in range(2, N_max + 1):
        counts[N] = counts[N - 1]  # Start with the previous count
        for p in primes:
            if p > N // 2:
                break
            if is_prime[N - p]:
                counts[N] += 1
    for idx, N in enumerate(N_list, 1):
        result = counts[N]
        print(f"Case #{idx}: {result}")

threading.Thread(target=main).start()
```
