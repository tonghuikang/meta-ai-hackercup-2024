**Key Findings:**

1. **Prime Sieve Utilization:** To efficiently determine prime numbers up to \(10^7\), the Sieve of Eratosthenes is employed. This allows for quick prime checks and generation of a list of primes.

2. **Expressibility Condition:** A prime number \(p\) is an \(N\)-subtractorization if there exists at least one prime \(q\) such that \(p + q\) is also prime and both \(p\) and \(q\) are \(\leq N\).

3. **Optimized Counting:** For each test case, iterate through the list of primes \(\leq N\) and check if there exists a corresponding prime \(q\) such that \(p + q\) is prime. To enhance performance:
   - Use a sieve for constant-time prime checks.
   - Break early once a valid \(q\) is found for a given \(p\) to avoid unnecessary computations.

4. **Precomputation Advantage:** By precomputing the sieve and the list of primes once, the solution efficiently handles multiple test cases without redundant calculations.

5. **Efficiency Considerations:** Given the constraints (\(T \leq 100\) and \(N \leq 10^7\)), the approach ensures that the solution remains within reasonable time and space limits, leveraging Python's optimized data structures like `bytearray` for the sieve.
