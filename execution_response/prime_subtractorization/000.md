**Key Findings:**

To efficiently solve the problem of counting the number of *$N$-subtractorizations* (primes that can be expressed as the difference of two primes ≤ *N*), we can utilize the following approach:

1. **Sieve of Eratosthenes:** 
   - Generate all prime numbers up to the maximum possible value of \( N \) (i.e., \( 10{,}000{,}000 \)) using the Sieve of Eratosthenes. This provides a fast way to identify prime numbers.

2. **Precompute Minimum Required \( N \) for Each Prime \( P \):**
   - For each prime \( P \), find the smallest prime \( B \) such that \( P + B \) is also prime. 
   - The minimal \( N \) required for \( P \) to be an *$N$-subtractorization* is \( P + B \).

3. **Cumulative Count Array:**
   - Create an array where each index \( i \) represents the number of valid *\( i \)-subtractorizations*.
   - Iterate through each prime \( P \) and increment the count at positions \( N \geq P + B \), ensuring that \( N \) is large enough to include both \( P \) and \( B \).

4. **Answering Queries:**
   - For each test case \( N \), simply retrieve the precomputed count from the cumulative array. This allows for constant-time query responses after the initial precomputations.

This methodology ensures that the solution runs efficiently, even for the upper constraints of the problem.
