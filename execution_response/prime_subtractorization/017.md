**Key Findings:**

1. **Prime Generation with Sieve of Eratosthenes**: To efficiently identify prime numbers up to the maximum \( N \) across all test cases, we utilize the Sieve of Eratosthenes. Given the constraints (\( N \leq 10^7 \)), this method is both time and space-efficient.

2. **Condition for \( N \)-Subtractorizations**: A prime number \( d \) is an \( N \)-subtractorization if there exists at least one prime \( q \) such that both \( q \) and \( q + d \) are primes and \( q + d \leq N \). This requires checking for each prime \( d \) whether such a \( q \) exists.

3. **Efficient Pair Checking Using Numpy**: Leveraging Numpy's optimized array operations allows us to perform vectorized checks for the existence of valid \( q \) for each prime difference \( d \). Specifically, by shifting the sieve array and performing element-wise logical AND operations, we can determine if there exists a pair \( (q, q + d) \) satisfying the conditions.

4. **Preprocessing and Binary Search for Multiple Test Cases**: By precomputing all valid \( d \) values up to the maximum \( N \) and sorting them, we can efficiently answer each test case by performing a binary search to count the number of valid \( d \)'s that are less than or equal to the given \( N \).

5. **Memory Management**: Storing the sieve as a boolean Numpy array is memory-efficient (~10 MB for \( N = 10^7 \)), ensuring that the solution remains within practical memory limits.

            # Perform the logical AND
            # To prevent memory issues, we can process in chunks if needed
