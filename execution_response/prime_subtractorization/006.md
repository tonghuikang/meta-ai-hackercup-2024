**Key Findings:**

1. **Prime Generation:** 
   - To solve the problem efficiently, we first need to generate all prime numbers up to the maximum possible value of \( N \) (which is \(10^7\)). The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an optimal algorithm for this purpose, allowing us to identify prime numbers up to \( N_{\text{max}} \) efficiently.

2. **Subtractorizations Concept:** 
   - An \( N \)-subtractorizations is defined as a prime number \( p \) that can be expressed as the difference of two primes \( q \) and \( r \) where both \( q \) and \( r \) are less than or equal to \( N \). Mathematically, \( p = q - r \) and both \( q \) and \( r \) are primes \( \leq N \).

3. **Efficient Counting Strategy:**
   - For each prime \( p \leq N \), we need to check if there exists at least one prime \( r \leq N - p \) such that \( p + r \) is also a prime \( \leq N \). 
   - To avoid redundant computations across multiple test cases, we can precompute the cumulative count of \( N \)-subtractorizations for all \( N \) up to \(10^7\). This allows us to answer each test case in constant time after the precomputation phase.

4. **Precomputation Optimization:**
   - By iterating through each prime \( r \), we can identify valid prime pairs \( (q, r) \) where \( q = p + r \) is also prime. For each valid pair, we mark \( p \) as a valid subtractorization.
   - To efficiently store and update the counts, we use an array where each index \( i \) represents the count of \( i \)-subtractorizations up to that point.

5. **Handling Large Inputs:**
   - Given the high upper limit for \( N \) and multiple test cases, it's crucial to manage memory and computational resources effectively. Using optimized data structures and minimizing redundant calculations ensures that the solution remains within acceptable performance bounds.

With these findings, we can structure our Python solution to efficiently handle the problem constraints.
