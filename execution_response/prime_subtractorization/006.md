**Key Findings:**

1. **Prime Identification:** Since we need to work with prime numbers up to \(10^7\), the Sieve of Eratosthenes is an efficient method to identify all primes within this range.

2. **Twin Prime Pairs:** An \(N\)-subtractorization involves finding primes \(p\) that can be expressed as the difference of two primes \(q - r = p\) where both \(q\) and \(r\) are primes \(\leq N\). Due to the nature of primes (except for 2, all primes are odd), the only valid scenarios where \(p + r\) is also prime occur when either \(p = 2\) or \(r = 2\).

3. **Counting Strategy:**
   - **For \(p \geq 3\):** A prime \(p\) is an \(N\)-subtractorization if \(p + 2\) is also prime and \(p + 2 \leq N\). This essentially counts twin prime pairs \((p, p+2)\).
   - **For \(p = 2\):** \(p = 2\) is counted as an \(N\)-subtractorization if there exists at least one prime \(r\) such that \(2 + r\) is also prime \(\leq N\). This condition is satisfied if there is at least one twin prime pair up to \(N\).

4. **Cumulative Counting:** To efficiently handle multiple test cases, precompute the cumulative count of twin prime pairs up to \(10^7\). For each test case \(N\):
   - If there is at least one twin prime pair \((p, p+2)\) where \(p \geq 3\) and \(p + 2 \leq N\), then the count of \(N\)-subtractorizations is the number of such twin pairs plus one (accounting for \(p = 2\)).
   - If no such twin pairs exist, the count is zero.
