To solve this problem efficiently, we need to avoid iterating over all pairs of primes directly due to the quadratic time complexity which is infeasible for large \( N \). Here's how we can tackle it:

**Key Findings:**

1. **Understanding the Problem Efficiently:** The problem asks for the number of primes \( p \leq N \) such that \( p = q - r \), where \( q \) and \( r \) are primes \( \leq N \).

2. **Precomputing Prime Differences:** Since we're dealing with differences of primes, instead of checking all pairs, we can generate all possible differences of primes within \( N \) and mark those primes that can be expressed as such.

3. **Optimizing Pair Generation:**
   - **Observation:** For each prime \( p \), the difference \( d = p2 - p1 \) (where \( p2 > p1 \)) can be at most \( N \).
   - **Implementation:** We can iterate over each prime \( p1 \), and then iterate over successive primes \( p2 \) until the difference \( d \) exceeds \( N \).
   - **Efficiency:** Since the average gap between successive primes is approximately \( \log N \), the total number of iterations is \( O(N \log N) \), which is acceptable.

4. **Algorithm Steps:**
   - **Generate Primes up to \( N_{\text{max}} \):** Use the Sieve of Eratosthenes to generate all primes up to the maximum \( N \) (\( N_{\text{max}} \)).
   - **Compute Prime Differences:** For each prime \( p_1 \), calculate \( d = p_2 - p_1 \) for successive primes \( p_2 \), and mark \( d \) if \( d \) is a prime and \( \leq N_{\text{max}} \).
   - **Count N-Subtractorizations:** For each test case with \( N \), count the number of primes \( p \leq N \) such that \( p \) is marked (i.e., it can be expressed as the difference of two primes \( \leq N \)).

5. **Memory and Time Efficiency:** By precomputing and storing the necessary values, we avoid redundant calculations, ensuring our solution is both memory and time efficient for the given constraints.

Here's the Python code implementing the above approach:

```python
import sys
import threading

def main():
    import bisect

    T = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    Ns = []
    N_max = 0
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(sys.stdin.readline())
        Ns.append(N)
        if N > N_max:
            N_max = N

    # Generate all primes up to N_max * 2 (to ensure all possible differences)
    N_max = max(Ns)
    sieve_limit = N_max
    sieve = [True] * (sieve_limit + 1)
    sieve[0:2] = [False, False]
    for i in range(2, int(sieve_limit**0.5) + 1):
        if sieve[i]:
            sieve[i*i:sieve_limit+1:i] = [False] * ((sieve_limit - i*i)//i + 1)
    primes = [i for i, is_prime in enumerate(sieve) if is_prime]

    # Precompute D[p] = True if p is difference of two primes <= N_max
    D = [False] * (N_max + 1)
    primes_set = set(primes)

    for idx1 in range(len(primes)):
        p1 = primes[idx1]
        for idx2 in range(idx1 + 1, len(primes)):
            p2 = primes[idx2]
            d = p2 - p1
            if d > N_max:
                break
            if sieve[d]:
                D[d] = True

    # For each test case, count the number of primes p <= N such that D[p] and p is prime
    for case_num, N in enumerate(Ns, 1):
        count = 0
        for p in primes:
            if p > N:
                break
            if D[p]:
                count +=1
        print(f"Case #{case_num}: {count}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    threading.Thread(target=main).start()
```

In this code:

- We first read all the inputs and find the maximum \( N \) among all test cases.
- We generate all primes up to \( N_{\text{max}} \) using the Sieve of Eratosthenes.
- We precompute an array \( D \) where \( D[p] \) is `True` if \( p \) is a difference of two primes \( \leq N_{\text{max}} \) and \( p \) is prime.
- For each test case, we count the number of primes \( p \) \( \leq N \) such that \( D[p] \) is `True`.
- By using `threading.Thread`, we ensure the program doesn't hit the recursion limit in some environments.

This solution efficiently handles large inputs within the given constraints and provides accurate results for each test case.
