To solve this problem, we need to find all primes \( D \) less than or equal to \( N \) that can be expressed as the difference between two primes \( P1 \) and \( P2 \) (both less than or equal to \( N \)), i.e., \( D = P1 - P2 \). This means we need to find all primes \( D \) such that there exists at least one prime \( P1 \) (greater than \( D \)) where both \( P1 \) and \( P1 - D \) are prime numbers.

Here's how we can approach this problem:

1. **Generate All Primes up to \( N_{max} \)**: Use the Sieve of Eratosthenes to generate all prime numbers up to the maximum value of \( N \) from the test cases.

2. **Precompute Minimum \( P \) for Each Prime Difference \( D \)**: For each prime \( D \), we find the smallest prime \( P \) such that \( P - D \) is also prime. We store this minimum \( P \) for each \( D \). This precomputation helps us to quickly answer queries for different \( N \) values.

3. **Answer Queries Efficiently**: For each test case, we need to count the number of primes \( D \) less than or equal to \( N \) such that \( D \) has a corresponding \( \text{min\_P} \) less than or equal to \( N \).

Key findings during solving this problem:

- **Optimizing Time Complexity**: Initially, it seems that checking all pairs of primes would be too time-consuming due to the complexity \( O(N^2) \). However, by precomputing the minimum \( P \) for each \( D \), we reduce the complexity significantly.

- **Preprocessing Step**: Preprocessing primes and the minimal primes \( P \) associated with each \( D \) allows us to answer each test case quickly during the query phase.

Below is the Python code implementing the above logic:

```python
import sys
import threading

def main():
    import bisect
    import math
    T = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    Ns = []
    N_max = 0
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(sys.stdin.readline())
        Ns.append(N)
        if N > N_max:
            N_max = N
    N_max += 1  # Ensure inclusive

    # Sieve of Eratosthenes to generate all primes up to N_max
    is_prime = [True] * N_max
    is_prime[0] = is_prime[1] = False
    for i in range(2, int(N_max ** 0.5) + 1):
        if is_prime[i]:
            for j in range(i * i, N_max, i):
                is_prime[j] = False

    primes = [i for i, val in enumerate(is_prime) if val]
    primes_set = set(primes)

    # Precompute min_P_for_D for each prime D
    min_P_for_D = {}
    for D in primes:
        min_P = None
        for P in primes:
            if P <= D:
                continue
            if (P - D) in primes_set:
                min_P = P
                break
        if min_P:
            min_P_for_D[D] = min_P
        else:
            min_P_for_D[D] = None

    # Process each test case
    for idx, N in enumerate(Ns, 1):
        count = 0
        for D in primes:
            if D > N:
                break
            if min_P_for_D[D] is not None and min_P_for_D[D] <= N:
                count += 1
        print(f'Case #{idx}: {count}')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    threading.Thread(target=main,).start()
