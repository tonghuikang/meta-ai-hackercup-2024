**Key Findings:**

1. **Prime Generation:** To identify *N-subtractorizations*, we first need to generate all prime numbers up to the maximum possible \( N \) (i.e., \( 10^7 \)) using the Sieve of Eratosthenes. Utilizing efficient data structures like NumPy arrays allows for faster sieve operations in Python.

2. **Efficient Lookup:** After generating the list of primes, we can efficiently check if a number is prime by referencing the sieve array. This is crucial when verifying if \( P + R \) is prime for given primes \( P \) and \( R \).

3. **Iterative Checking:** For each test case with a specific \( N \), iterate through all primes \( P \) up to \( N-2 \). For each \( P \), iterate through primes \( R \) up to \( N-P \) and check if \( P + R \) is also prime. If such an \( R \) exists, \( P \) qualifies as an *N-subtractorizations*.

4. **Optimization via Early Termination:** To enhance performance, once a valid \( R \) is found for a given \( P \), we can immediately count \( P \) and move to the next prime. This avoids unnecessary checks and reduces the overall computation time.

5. **Preprocessing:** Since multiple test cases are involved, it's efficient to preprocess the sieve and the list of primes once before handling all test cases. This avoids redundant computations and speeds up the solution.

6. **Handling Large Inputs:** Given the constraints (\( N \) up to \( 10^7 \) and \( T \) up to 100), using optimized libraries and data structures (like NumPy) is essential to manage memory and ensure the solution executes within acceptable time limits.
