**Key Findings:**

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to determine the number of *N-subtractorizations*, which are prime numbers that can be expressed as the difference between two primes, both of which are at most \( N \).
   - For example, for \( N = 5 \):
     - \( 5 - 3 = 2 \) (both 5 and 3 are primes)
     - \( 5 - 2 = 3 \) (both 5 and 2 are primes)
     - The set of subtractorizations is \(\{2, 3\}\), totaling 2.

2. **Constraints Analysis:**
   - Number of test cases \( T \) can be up to 100.
   - \( N \) can be as large as \( 10^7 \), which implies the need for an efficient algorithm to handle large inputs within reasonable time and memory limits.

3. **Approach:**
   - **Prime Generation:**
     - Utilize the Sieve of Eratosthenes to generate all prime numbers up to the maximum \( N \) across all test cases efficiently.
   - **Subtraction Logic:**
     - For each prime \( q \) (where \( q \leq N \)), iterate through primes \( r \) (where \( r \leq q \)) and calculate \( p = q - r \).
     - If \( p \) is also a prime and \( p \leq N \), it's a valid subtractorization.
     - To optimize, instead of iterating through all possible \( r \) for each \( q \), we can iterate through the list of primes and check if \( q - r \) is prime using the precomputed sieve.
   - **Optimization:**
     - Precompute primes only once up to the maximum \( N \) required.
     - Use a set or a boolean array to keep track of valid subtractorizations to avoid duplicates and allow for constant-time checks.
     - Since \( N \) can be large (\( 10^7 \)), memory-efficient data structures and algorithms are crucial.

4. **Implementation Considerations:**
   - Given Python's inherent speed limitations for large-scale iterations, careful optimizations are necessary.
   - Leveraging efficient data structures like lists for sieve and avoiding nested loops where possible can help in meeting performance requirements.

**Python Code:**

```python
import sys
import threading

def main():
    import sys

    import sys

    T_and_tests = sys.stdin.read().split()
    T = int(T_and_tests[0])
    Ns = list(map(int, T_and_tests[1:T+1]))

    max_N = max(Ns)

    # Sieve of Eratosthenes
    sieve_size = max_N + 1
    sieve = bytearray([1]) * sieve_size
    sieve[0:2] = b'\x00\x00'
    for i in range(2, int(max_N**0.5) + 1):
        if sieve[i]:
            sieve[i*i:max_N+1:i] = b'\x00' * len(sieve[i*i:max_N+1:i])
    primes = [i for i, is_prime in enumerate(sieve) if is_prime]

    # Create a set for faster lookup
    prime_set = set(primes)

    # Precompute subtractorizations
    # For each prime q, iterate through primes r <= q, p = q - r
    # If p is prime and p <= max_N, mark p
    # To optimize, iterate through primes and for each q, iterate through r until r > q
    # But even better, for each q, iterate through r until q - r >= 2
    subtractorizations = [0] * (max_N +1)
    for q in primes:
        for r in primes:
            if r > q:
                break
            p = q - r
            if p < 2:
                continue
            if sieve[p]:
                subtractorizations[p] = 1
    # Now, create a prefix sum array
    prefix_sum = [0] * (max_N +1)
    count = 0
    for i in range(2, max_N +1):
        if subtractorizations[i]:
            count +=1
        prefix_sum[i] = count

    for idx, N in enumerate(Ns,1):
        print(f"Case #{idx}: {prefix_sum[N]}")
