**Key Findings:**

To solve the problem of finding the number of *$N$-subtractorizations*, we can follow these steps:

1. **Prime Generation:**
   - Use the Sieve of Eratosthenes to generate all prime numbers up to the maximum value of \( N \) across all test cases. This is efficient even for \( N \) up to \( 10^7 \).

2. **Subtractorizations Counting:**
   - For each test case with a given \( N \):
     - Iterate through all prime numbers \( s \) up to \( N \).
     - For each \( s \), check if there exists at least one prime \( q \) such that \( s + q \) is also a prime and \( s + q \leq N \).
     - If such a \( q \) exists, \( s \) is a valid *$N$-subtractorizations*.
   - Count all such valid \( s \) for each \( N \).

3. **Optimization:**
   - Precompute the sieve only once for the maximum \( N \) to handle multiple test cases efficiently.
   - Use binary search or two-pointer techniques to quickly find valid pairs \( (p, q) \) where \( p = s + q \) is prime.

This approach ensures that even with multiple test cases and large values of \( N \), the solution remains efficient.
