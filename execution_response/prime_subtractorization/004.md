When solving this problem, several key observations and optimizations are essential to handle the constraints efficiently:

1. **Prime Sieve Representation**:
   - Utilize the Sieve of Eratosthenes to precompute all prime numbers up to the maximum `N` across all test cases. 
   - Represent the sieve as a bitmask using a Python integer, where each bit corresponds to a number: the bit is set (`1`) if the number is prime and unset (`0`) otherwise. This allows for efficient bitwise operations.

2. **Efficient Counting with Bitwise Operations**:
   - For each prime `p` ≤ `N`, check if there exists at least one prime `r` such that both `r` and `p + r` are primes ≤ `N`.
   - This can be efficiently determined by shifting the prime bitmask left by `p` positions and performing a bitwise AND with the original mask. If the result is non-zero, it indicates that there is at least one such `r`.

3. **Preprocessing**:
   - Read all test cases first to determine the maximum `N` required.
   - Precompute the sieve and the list of primes up to this maximum `N` once, avoiding redundant computations for each test case.

4. **Counting Valid Subtractorizations**:
   - For each test case, iterate through the list of primes ≤ `N` and use the bitmask to determine if they can be expressed as the difference of two primes ≤ `N`.
   - Maintain a cumulative count for each test case based on these checks.

5. **Optimization Considerations**:
   - Since `N` can be as large as 10,000,000, it's crucial to implement the sieve and bitwise checks efficiently. Python's handling of large integers and bitwise operations makes this feasible.

Below is the Python code implementing the above strategy:

```python
import sys
import threading

def main():
    import sys
    import math

    sys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)
    T_and_N = sys.stdin.read().split()
    T = int(T_and_N[0])
    N_list = list(map(int, T_and_N[1:T+1]))
    N_max = max(N_list)

    # Sieve of Eratosthenes up to N_max
    sieve = [True] * (N_max + 1)
    sieve[0] = sieve[1] = False
    for i in range(2, int(math.isqrt(N_max)) +1):
        if sieve[i]:
            sieve[i*i:N_max+1:i] = [False] * len(range(i*i, N_max+1, i))
    # Create list of primes
    primes = [i for i, is_p in enumerate(sieve) if is_p]
    # Create sieve as integer bitmask
    A = 0
    for p in primes:
        A |= 1 << p

    # For faster access, create a list to map N to its corresponding prime set
    # But since N can be up to 10^7, we need a way to handle it
    # Instead, for each N, we can mask the sieve up to N

    # Precompute cumulative prime list
    # Not necessary, as we have the list

    # Process each test case
    for idx in range(T):
        N = N_list[idx]
        # Mask the sieve up to N
        A_N = A & ((1 << (N +1)) -1)
        count = 0
        for p in primes:
            if p > N:
                break
            # Check if there exists r <=N - p such that r is prime and p + r is prime
            # Which is equivalent to checking if (A << p) & A_N has any bit set
            shifted = A_N << p
            # Only keep bits up to N + p, but since A_N has bits up to N, shifted has bits up to 2N
            # But p <=N, so p + r <= N + p <= 2N, but we need p + r <= N, so r <=N - p
            # Thus, mask shifted with (1 << (N +1)) -1
            shifted &= (1 << (N +1)) -1
            if (shifted & A_N) !=0:
                count +=1
        print(f"Case #{idx+1}: {count}")

threading.Thread(target=main).start()
