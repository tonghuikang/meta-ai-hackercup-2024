**Key Findings:**

1. **Prime Generation:** To determine *N-subtractorizations*, we need to identify all prime numbers up to the maximum value of \( N \) across all test cases. The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an efficient method for generating all prime numbers up to a given limit.

2. **Understanding Subtractorizations:** A prime number \( p \) is an *N-subtractorizations* if there exist two primes \( q \) and \( r \) (both \( \leq N \)) such that \( p = q - r \). This can be rephrased as finding pairs of primes \( (p, r) \) where \( p + r \) is also prime and \( p + r \leq N \).

3. **Efficient Checking:** Instead of checking all possible pairs \( (q, r) \), we can iterate through each prime \( p \) and check if there's at least one prime \( r \) such that \( p + r \) is also prime and \( p + r \leq N \). Utilizing the precomputed sieve allows for constant-time prime checks.

4. **Optimizing for Multiple Test Cases:** Since the maximum \( N \) can be up to \( 10^7 \) and there are up to 100 test cases, it's efficient to:
   - Read all test cases first to determine the highest \( N \).
   - Generate the sieve and list of primes up to this maximum \( N \) once.
   - For each test case, iterate through the primes up to \( N \) and count those that satisfy the subtractorization condition.

5. **Avoiding Redundant Computations:** By breaking the inner loop once a valid \( r \) is found for a given \( p \), we prevent unnecessary computations and speed up the process.

            # Since p + r <= N, and sieve is up to N

                q = p + r

                    count +=1
                    break  # Only need at least one r for each p
        print(f"Case #{idx}: {count}")
