**Key Findings:**

1. **Understanding N-Subtractorizations:** An *N-subtractorization* is defined as a prime number \( p \) that can be expressed as the difference \( p = q - r \), where both \( q \) and \( r \) are prime numbers not exceeding \( N \). 

2. **Prime Precomputation:** To efficiently solve multiple test cases, it's essential to precompute all prime numbers up to \( 2 \times 10^7 \) using the Sieve of Eratosthenes. This is because the difference \( p = q - r \) can potentially be as large as \( N - 2 \), and the sum \( q + r \) can go up to \( 2 \times 10^7 \).

3. **Minimal \( q \) for Each \( p \):** For each prime \( p \), we need to find the smallest prime \( q \) such that \( p = q - r \) for some prime \( r \). This ensures that for any given \( N \), if this minimal \( q \) is less than or equal to \( N \), \( p \) is counted as an \( N \)-subtractorization.

4. **Efficient Counting Using Sorting and Binary Search:** After identifying the minimal \( q \) for each \( p \), we sort these minimal values. For each test case, we can then use binary search to quickly determine how many \( p \) values have their minimal \( q \) within the given \( N \).

5. **Vectorized Operations with NumPy:** Utilizing NumPy's vectorized operations significantly speeds up the computation, especially when dealing with large arrays of prime numbers.

**Python Code:**

```python
import sys
import bisect
import numpy as np

def main():
    import sys

    MAX_N =10_000_000
    SIEVE_LIMIT =2 * MAX_N +1

    # Initialize sieve
    sieve = np.ones(SIEVE_LIMIT, dtype=bool)
    sieve[:2] = False

    # Sieve of Eratosthenes
    sqrt_limit = int(SIEVE_LIMIT**0.5) +1
    for i in range(2, sqrt_limit):
        if sieve[i]:
            sieve[i*i:SIEVE_LIMIT:i] = False

    # Extract primes up to MAX_N
    primes_p = np.nonzero(sieve[:MAX_N+1])[0]
    primes_r = primes_p.copy()

    # Initialize min_N array
    min_N = np.zeros(MAX_N+1, dtype=np.int32)

    # Iterate over r in primes_r
    for r in primes_r:
        # Compute p + r
        p_plus_r = primes_p + r

        # Create mask where p + r is prime and <= MAX_N
        mask = (p_plus_r <= MAX_N) & sieve[p_plus_r]

        # Get p candidates where p + r is prime
        p_candidates = primes_p[mask]

        # Further mask to find p's where min_N[p] is not yet set
        unmarked = (min_N[p_candidates] ==0)
        p_use = p_candidates[unmarked]

        # Set min_N[p] = p + r
        min_N[p_use] = p_use + r

    # Extract min_N[p] for p in primes_p where min_N[p] >0
    valid_min_N = min_N[primes_p]
    valid_min_N = valid_min_N[valid_min_N >0]

    # Sort the valid_min_N array
    sorted_min_N = np.sort(valid_min_N)

    # Read input
    input = sys.stdin.read().split()
    T =int(input[0])
    for i in range(1,T+1):
        N = int(input[i])
        # Use binary search to find the count of min_N[p] <=N
        count = bisect.bisect_right(sorted_min_N, N)
        print(f"Case #{i}: {count}")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

**Explanation of the Code:**

1. **Sieve Initialization:** We initialize a sieve using NumPy to efficiently identify prime numbers up to \( 2 \times 10^7 \). This is crucial for handling the maximum possible difference and sum of primes.

2. **Prime Extraction:** Extract all prime numbers up to \( N \) and store them in `primes_p`. These will be used to compute the minimal \( q \) for each \( p \).

3. **Minimal \( q \) Calculation:** For each prime \( r \), we compute \( p + r \) and check if it results in a prime number. If it does and if \( min\_N[p] \) hasn't been set yet, we update it with the current \( q \).

4. **Sorting for Efficient Queries:** Once all minimal \( q \) values are computed, we sort them. This allows us to use binary search (`bisect_right`) to quickly determine how many \( p \) values satisfy \( min\_N[p] \leq N \) for each test case.

5. **Handling Multiple Test Cases:** The script reads all test cases, processes each, and outputs the result in the required format.

This approach ensures that the solution is both time and memory efficient, making it suitable for handling the given constraints.
