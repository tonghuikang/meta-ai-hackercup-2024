To solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given variant of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm correctly computes the shortest path distances on a tree. The key insight lies in understanding how the order of the loops affects the correctness of the algorithm.

### Key Findings:

1. **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**: The standard Floyd-Warshall algorithm uses `k` as the outermost loop, ensuring that all possible intermediate nodes are considered before updating the distance matrix. This guarantees the correctness of the shortest paths.

2. **Loop Order Impact**: Variants of the algorithm with different loop orders may not correctly update the distance matrix. Specifically:
   - If `k` is the outermost loop (i.e., the loop order starts with `k`), the algorithm behaves like the standard Floyd-Warshall and correctly computes all shortest paths. Therefore, loop orders `'kij'` and `'kji'` are always correct (`"Lucky"`).
   - For all other loop orders where `k` is not the outermost loop (e.g., `'ijk'`, `'ikj'`, `'jik'`, `'jki'`), the algorithm does not guarantee correct distance computations (`"Wrong"`).

3. **Implementation Strategy**:
   - For each test case, check if the loop order starts with `'k'`.
   - If it does (`'kij'` or `'kji'`), output `"Lucky"`.
   - Otherwise, output `"Wrong"`.

Given the problem constraints, this approach is efficient and correctly identifies whether the algorithm variant will produce the correct distance matrix.

    data = input().split()
    idx = 0

    for tc in range(1, T+1):
        S = data[idx]; idx +=1
        N = int(data[idx]); idx +=1
        edges = []
        for _ in range(N-1):
            u = int(data[idx]); idx +=1
            v = int(data[idx]); idx +=1
            edges.append( (u,v) )
        # Determine if S starts with 'k'
        if S[0] == 'k':
            res = "Lucky"
        else:
            res = "Wrong"
        print(f"Case #{tc}: {res}")
