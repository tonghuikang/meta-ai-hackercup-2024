To solve this problem, we need to determine whether the provided code snippet, given by the string `S`, correctly computes the shortest path distances between all pairs of nodes in a tree.

We analyze the problem step by step:

1. **Understanding the Code Snippet and Loop Order:**
   - The provided code snippets are variants of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm with different loop orders.
   - The standard Floyd-Warshall algorithm loops over `k` in the outermost loop (i.e., `kij` or `kji`), which ensures correct computation of shortest paths for all graphs.

2. **Identifying Correct Loop Orders:**
   - Loop orders with `k` as the outermost loop (i.e., `kij` and `kji`) are guaranteed to compute the correct shortest distances for all pairs in any graph.
   - Other loop orders may not produce correct results in general but may work for small graphs or specific tree structures.

3. **Approach Based on Graph Size:**
   - For small graphs (e.g., `N <= 5000`), we can simulate the code snippet as given and compare the results to the actual shortest path distances computed using BFS.
   - For larger graphs, simulating the code snippet is computationally infeasible. Therefore, we rely on our analysis that only loop orders with `k` outermost ensure correct computations.

4. **Implementing the Solution:**
   - For each test case, if `N <= 5000`, we:
     - Simulate the code snippet according to the loop order specified by `S`.
     - Compute the actual shortest distances using BFS from each node.
     - Compare the two distance matrices.
     - Output `"Lucky"` if they match, `"Wrong"` otherwise.
   - If `N > 5000`, we:
     - Output `"Lucky"` if `S` is either `"kij"` or `"kji"`.
     - Output `"Wrong"` for other values of `S`.

5. **Handling the Input and Output:**
   - We read the input and parse each test case accordingly.
   - We ensure proper mapping of loop variables based on the string `S`.
   - We output the result for each test case with the required format.

Here is the Python code implementing the above approach:

        S = sys.stdin.readline().strip()
        N = int(sys.stdin.readline())
        edges = [[] for _ in range(N+1)]
        for _ in range(N-1):
            U, V = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
            edges[U].append(V)
            edges[V].append(U)
        # Check if N <= 5000 to simulate
        if N <= 5000:
