When solving this problem, the key insight revolves around understanding the Floyd-Warshall algorithm's dependency on the loop order. Specifically, the algorithm is guaranteed to work correctly when the outermost loop iterates through the intermediate node `k`. In this problem, only two loop orders (`kij` and `kji`) correctly represent this standard approach. Any other loop order can potentially lead to incorrect distance calculations, especially given the unique paths inherent in tree structures.

Therefore, the solution involves checking if the provided loop order string `S` starts with `'k'`. If it does (`kij` or `kji`), the algorithm will correctly compute the shortest paths, and we should output "`Lucky`". For all other loop orders where `'k'` is not the first character, the algorithm does not guarantee correct results, and we should output "`Wrong`".

```python
import sys

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    T = int(data[idx]); idx +=1
    for case in range(1, T+1):
        S = data[idx]; idx +=1
        N = int(data[idx]); idx +=1
        # skip N-1 edges
        idx += 2*(N-1)
        # Determine if S starts with 'k'
        if S[0] == 'k':
            result = "Lucky"
        else:
            result = "Wrong"
        print(f"Case #{case}: {result}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
