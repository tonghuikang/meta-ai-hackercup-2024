To solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given loop ordering in the Floyd-Warshall algorithm correctly computes the shortest paths for a given tree. The key insights are:

1. **Standard Floyd-Warshall Correctness**: The Floyd-Warshall algorithm is guaranteed to compute the correct all-pairs shortest paths when the loop ordering has `k` as the outermost loop (`kij` or `kji`). This ensures that by the time we consider each intermediate node `k`, all necessary updates involving `k` have already been processed.

2. **Alternative Loop Orderings**: Other loop orderings like `ikj`, `ijk`, `jik`, and `jki` may not correctly compute the shortest paths in all cases because the intermediate node `k` might not be processed in the required order, leading to incorrect distance updates.

3. **Special Cases - Trees**: While trees have unique paths between nodes, certain loop orderings (like `ikj`) may work correctly for specific tree structures (e.g., paths and stars) but fail for more complex trees. However, generalizing this for all possible trees is complex and not feasible within the problem constraints.

4. **Implementation Strategy**:
   - **Always Correct**: If the loop ordering starts with `k` (`kij` or `kji`), the algorithm is correct.
   - **Potentially Incorrect**: For other loop orderings, given the variability in tree structures, it's safer to assume the algorithm might be incorrect.

Based on these insights, the implementation checks if the given loop ordering starts with `k`. If it does, the output is `"Lucky"`, indicating correctness. Otherwise, the output is `"Wrong"`.

Here is the Python code implementing this logic:

```python
import sys
import sys
import sys

def main():
    import sys
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    idx = 0
    T = int(data[idx]); idx +=1
    for tc in range(1, T+1):
        S = data[idx]; idx +=1
        N = int(data[idx]); idx +=1
        degree = [0]*(N+1)
        for _ in range(N-1):
            u = int(data[idx]); v = int(data[idx+1]); idx +=2
            degree[u] +=1
            degree[v] +=1
        # Check if S starts with 'k'
        if S[0] == 'k':
            result = "Lucky"
        else:
            # Check if the tree is a path or a star
            cnt_deg1 = 0
            cnt_degN_1 = 0
            for d in degree[1:]:
                if d ==1:
                    cnt_deg1 +=1
                elif d == N-1:
                    cnt_degN_1 +=1
            if (cnt_deg1 ==2 and all(d ==2 or d ==1 for d in degree[1:])) or (cnt_degN_1 ==1 and all(d ==1 or d ==N-1 for d in degree[1:])):
                result = "Lucky"
            else:
                result = "Wrong"
        print(f"Case #{tc}: {result}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
