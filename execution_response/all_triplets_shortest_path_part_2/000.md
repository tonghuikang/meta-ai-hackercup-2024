To solve this problem, we need to determine whether the given loop order for the Floyd-Warshall-like algorithm correctly computes the shortest path distances for all pairs of nodes in a tree. 

**Key Findings:**

1. **Floyd-Warshall Requirements:** The standard Floyd-Warshall algorithm uses the loop order with `k` as the outermost loop (`kij`). This order ensures that when processing node `k`, all necessary intermediate distances involving node `k` are correctly updated based on previously computed values.

2. **Loop Order Impact:** The correctness of the algorithm heavily depends on the position of `k` in the loop order. When `k` is the outermost loop (i.e., loop order starts with `k`), it guarantees correctness. If `k` is placed in the middle or as the innermost loop, the algorithm might fail to compute correct distances because the necessary intermediate values may not have been updated yet.

3. **Tree Structures:** While trees have unique paths between nodes, which might seem to make the algorithm more forgiving, the loop order still plays a critical role. Only loop orders where `k` is the outermost loop (`kij` or `kji`) consistently ensure all distances are correctly computed.

4. **Implementation Strategy:** Given the large constraints (with `N` up to 300,000 and total `N` across test cases up to 8,000,000), it's impractical to simulate the entire algorithm. Instead, we can deduce that only when `k` is the first character in the loop order (`kij` or `kji`), the algorithm will always correctly compute the distances. For all other loop orders, the algorithm may produce incorrect results.

Based on these findings, the solution checks if the loop order starts with `k`. If it does, we output "`Lucky`", otherwise, we output "`Wrong`".

    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    T = int(data[idx]); idx +=1
    for case in range(1, T+1):
        S = data[idx]; idx +=1
        N = int(data[idx]); idx +=1
        # Skip N-1 edges
        idx += 2*(N-1)
        # Determine if loop order starts with 'k'
        if S[0] == 'k':
            result = "Lucky"
        else:
            result = "Wrong"
        print(f"Case #{case}: {result}")
