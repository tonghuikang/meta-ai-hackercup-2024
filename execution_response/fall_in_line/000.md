**Key Findings:**

1. **Objective Clarification:** The problem requires determining the minimal number of ants that need to be moved so that all ants lie on a single straight line. Mathematically, this translates to finding the maximum number of collinear points (ants) and then subtracting this count from the total number of ants \( N \).

2. **Challenge with Large \( N \):** Given that \( N \) can be up to \( 1{,}000{,}000 \) per test case and up to \( 4{,}000{,}000 \) across all test cases, traditional \( O(N^2) \) approaches to finding collinear points are computationally infeasible.

3. **Probabilistic Approach:** To handle large \( N \), a probabilistic method can be employed. By randomly sampling a subset of point pairs and determining the lines they define, we can estimate the maximum number of collinear points with high probability.

4. **Optimizing for Performance:**
   - **Random Sampling:** Instead of checking all possible pairs, randomly sample a fixed number of pairs (e.g., 500) to define potential lines.
   - **Hashing Lines:** Represent lines in a canonical form to avoid precision issues and use hashing to count occurrences efficiently.
   - **Early Termination:** If a line with a sufficiently high number of collinear points is found during sampling, the search can be terminated early to save computation time.

5. **Handling Edge Cases:** 
   - **All Points Collinear:** If all ants are already on a single line, no movements are needed.
   - **Minimal Points:** With \( N = 2 \), the two points already form a line, so no movements are required.

6. **Accuracy Consideration:** The problem allows answers between \( M \) and \( 2M \), where \( M \) is the true minimal number of moves. This flexibility accommodates the probabilistic nature of the solution, ensuring that approximate results within the acceptable range are sufficient.
