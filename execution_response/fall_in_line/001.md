**Key Findings:**

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The task is to determine the minimum number of ants that need to move so that all ants lie on a single straight line.
   - This equates to finding the maximum number of colinear points among the given coordinates. The minimum number of moves is then `N - max_colinear_points`.

2. **Constraints Analysis:**
   - Given the large possible value of \( N \) (up to 1,000,000 per test case) and the total sum across all test cases (up to 4,000,000), a brute-force approach (which typically requires \( O(N^2) \) time) is infeasible.
   - An approximate solution is acceptable, as the answer can range between \( M \) and \( 2M \), where \( M \) is the true minimum number of moves.

3. **Approach:**
   - **Random Sampling:** To handle large datasets efficiently, we can use probabilistic methods like random sampling. By randomly selecting a subset of points and determining lines defined by pairs within this subset, we can estimate the maximum number of colinear points.
   - **Hashing Slopes:** For each selected point, calculate the slope it forms with other points and use a hash map to count occurrences of each slope. The slope with the highest count indicates the most colinear points with that base point.
   - **Optimization:** Limit the number of base points sampled (e.g., 500) to ensure the algorithm remains efficient even with large \( N \). If a test case has a small \( N \) (e.g., \( N \leq 1000 \)), compute the exact result using a more thorough approach.

4. **Probability Consideration:**
   - By sampling a sufficient number of base points, we increase the likelihood of identifying the line with the maximum number of colinear points, ensuring the approximate solution falls within the acceptable range.

**Explanation of the Code:**

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The `readints` function efficiently reads a line of integers from standard input.
   - For each test case, it reads \( N \) points as \((X_i, Y_i)\).

2. **Max Colinear Calculation (`max_colinear` function):**
   - **Exact Computation:** For smaller \( N \) (e.g., \( N \leq 1000 \)), it iterates through each point, calculates slopes to every other point, and uses a hash map to count colinear points for each unique slope. The maximum count across all slopes gives the maximum number of colinear points.
   - **Approximate Computation:** For larger \( N \), it randomly samples a subset of points (e.g., 500) and performs the same slope counting as in the exact method. This probabilistic approach provides an estimate of the maximum colinear points without the computational overhead of checking all pairs.

3. **Slope Representation:**
   - To handle precision and avoid floating-point inaccuracies, slopes are represented as reduced fractions using the greatest common divisor (GCD). Vertical lines are represented distinctly as `('inf', 0)`.

4. **Output:**
   - For each test case, it prints the minimum number of moves required, formatted as specified.

5. **Performance Optimization:**
   - The use of `threading` and efficient data structures like `defaultdict` ensures the code runs within acceptable time limits, even for large input sizes.

6. **Randomness:**
   - The random sampling approach ensures that even though the solution is approximate, it has a high probability of being within the acceptable range defined by the problem.

This approach balances efficiency with the need for accuracy, ensuring that the solution is both fast and within the problem's acceptable bounds.
