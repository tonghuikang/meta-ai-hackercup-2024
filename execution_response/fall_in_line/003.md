**Key Findings:**

1. **Problem Reduction:**
   - The task is to determine the minimum number of ants that need to move so all ants lie on a single straight line. This is equivalent to finding the largest subset of colinear points \( K \) among \( N \) points, and then computing \( M = N - K \).

2. **Challenges:**
   - **Large Input Size:** With \( N \) potentially up to 1,000,000 and the total sum of \( N \) across test cases up to 4,000,000, an \( O(N^2) \) approach is infeasible.
   - **Precision Requirements:** Although an exact solution is ideal, the problem allows answers within a factor of 2 of \( M \), enabling approximate methods.

3. **Approach:**
   - **Exact Method for Small \( N \):** For smaller datasets (e.g., \( N \leq 5000 \)), use an exact approach by iterating through each point and counting the number of points that share the same slope relative to it.
   - **Random Sampling for Large \( N \):** For larger datasets, implement a randomized sampling technique:
     - Randomly select a subset of points.
     - For each sampled point, compute slopes to all other points and identify the most frequent slope, which indicates colinearity.
     - The maximum count from these samples serves as an estimate for \( K \).
   - **Optimization:** Utilize efficient data structures like dictionaries (hash maps) to count slope occurrences and implement slope normalization to handle precision and avoid floating-point inaccuracies.

4. **Implementation Details:**
   - **Slope Representation:** To accurately determine colinearity without floating-point errors, represent slopes as reduced fractions (dy/dx) by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD).
   - **Handling Vertical Lines:** Special care is taken to handle vertical lines where the denominator (dx) is zero.
   - **Efficient Input Parsing:** Given the large input size, read the entire input at once and process it in chunks to minimize I/O overhead.

The following Python code implements the above approach:

            if i == j:
                continue
