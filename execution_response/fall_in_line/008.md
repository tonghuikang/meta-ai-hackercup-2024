To solve this problem efficiently given the large constraints, consider the following key findings:

**Key Findings:**

1. **Maximum Colinear Points:** The primary goal is to find the maximum number of ants that already lie on a single straight line. The minimum number of ants to move, \(M\), will then be \(N - \text{max\_colinear}\).

2. **Optimality vs. Efficiency Trade-off:** Given the large value of \(N\) (up to 1,000,000 per test case) and the sum of \(N\) across test cases (up to 4,000,000), a brute-force approach to check every pair of points for colinearity is computationally infeasible (since it would be \(O(N^2)\)).

3. **Random Sampling:** To overcome the computational challenge, use a randomized approach:
   - Randomly select a subset of points and consider lines formed by these points.
   - For each selected line, count the number of points that lie on it.
   - Keep track of the maximum count obtained from these sampled lines.
   - This method offers an approximation that falls within the acceptable range of \(M\) to \(2*M\).

4. **Probability and Sampling Size:** Choosing an adequate number of random samples increases the probability of identifying a line with a high number of colinear points. A sampling size of around 30 iterations is a practical balance between performance and accuracy for this problem.

5. **Efficiency Considerations:** Utilize hashing to represent lines uniquely by their slope and intercept, considering precision by normalizing the slope as a reduced fraction.

**Python Code:**

```python
import sys
import random
import math
from collections import defaultdict

def readints():
    return list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))

def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def get_line(p1, p2):
    x1, y1 = p1
    x2, y2 = p2
    A = y2 - y1
    B = x1 - x2
    C = A * x1 + B * y1
    # Normalize
    g = gcd(abs(A), abs(B))
    g = gcd(g, abs(C)) if C != 0 else g
    A //= g
    B //= g
    C //= g
    if A < 0 or (A == 0 and B < 0):
        A, B, C = -A, -B, -C
    return (A, B, C)

def main():
    import sys
    import time
    T = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    for test_case in range(1, T+1):
        N = int(sys.stdin.readline())
        points = [tuple(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())) for _ in range(N)]
        if N <= 2:
            print(f"Case #{test_case}: 0")
            continue
        max_on_line = 0
        # Number of random samples
        samples = 30
        for _ in range(samples):
            p1, p2 = random.sample(points, 2)
            A = p2[1] - p1[1]
            B = p1[0] - p2[0]
            C = A * p1[0] + B * p1[1]
            # Normalize
            g = gcd(abs(A), abs(B))
            g = gcd(g, abs(C)) if C != 0 else g
            A //= g
            B //= g
            C //= g
            if A < 0 or (A == 0 and B < 0):
                A, B, C = -A, -B, -C
            count = 0
            for x, y in points:
                if A * x + B * y == C:
                    count +=1
            if count > max_on_line:
                max_on_line = count
                if max_on_line > N - max_on_line:
                    break
        M = N - max_on_line
        print(f"Case #{test_case}: {M}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Input Parsing:** The `readints` function reads integers from standard input. The main function processes each test case by reading \(N\) and the corresponding \(N\) points.

2. **Handling Small Cases:** For \(N \leq 2\), no movement is needed since two points always lie on a straight line.

3. **Random Sampling:** For larger \(N\), perform a fixed number of random samples (e.g., 30). In each sample:
   - Randomly select two distinct points to define a line.
   - Normalize the line representation to handle uniqueness and avoid floating-point precision issues.
   - Count how many points lie on this line.

4. **Maximizing Colinear Points:** Keep track of the maximum number of points found on any sampled line. If this maximum exceeds half of \(N\), further sampling can be stopped early as it won't yield a better result.

5. **Output:** For each test case, output the minimal number of ants to move, \(M = N - \text{max\_on\_line}\).

**Note:** This randomized approach provides a solution within the acceptable range of \(M\) to \(2*M\) due to the probabilistic nature of random sampling, which is suitable given the problem's constraints and the requirement for an approximate answer.
