**Key Findings:**

1. **Grouping by Color:**
   - First, group rabbits based on their assigned shirt colors. Each group (color) must contain at least two rabbits since no color is worn by exactly one rabbit.

2. **Handling Known Weights:**
   - For each color group, identify rabbits with known weights. Ensure that these known weights are unique and fall within the specified range [1, 10,000].

3. **Assigning Missing Weights:**
   - For rabbits with missing weights (`-1`), assign weights such that:
     - All weights across all rabbits are unique.
     - Assigned weights are within the range [1, 10,000].
     - Within each color group, the difference between the maximum and minimum weights (`F(c)`) is minimized. This implies assigning weights as close as possible to existing known weights in the same group.

4. **Minimizing the Sum of F(c):**
   - To achieve the minimal sum of `F(c)` across all color groups, it's optimal to assign missing weights close to the median of the existing weights within each group. If a group has no known weights, assign a contiguous range of unused weights to minimize the range.

5. **Validation:**
   - After assigning weights, validate that:
     - All weights are unique.
     - All weights are within the allowed range.
     - Each color group contains at least two rabbits.
     - The sum of `F(c)` is indeed minimized based on the assignments.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - If it's impossible to assign weights while satisfying all constraints (e.g., not enough available weights, conflicting assignments), output "No".

7. **Efficiency Considerations:**
   - Given the constraints (especially with up to \(10^5\) test cases and \(N \leq 300\)), optimize the solution for speed by:
     - Preprocessing available weights.
     - Using efficient data structures for grouping and assignment.
     - Avoiding unnecessary computations within loops.
