To solve this problem, we need to determine whether it's possible to fill in the missing rabbit weights such that the provided shirt color assignments would result in the minimal possible total sum of differences \( F(c) \) across all shirt colors.

**Key Findings:**

1. **Constraints Analysis:**
   - Known weights are unique and fixed; we cannot modify them.
   - Missing weights must be assigned integers within `[1, 10,000]`, ensuring all weights remain unique.
   - The minimal possible total sum of \( F(c) \) depends on the assigned weights and how well we can minimize the interval `[min_c, max_c]` per color group.

2. **Problem Simplification:**
   - For each color group, we aim to minimize \( F(c) = max_c - min_c \).
   - Missing weights should ideally be assigned within the known interval `[min_c, max_c]` to avoid expanding the interval and increasing \( F(c) \).
   - If necessary, we can extend the interval minimally to include additional weights while trying to keep \( F(c) \) as low as possible.

3. **Algorithm Overview:**
   - For each color group:
     - Determine the known weights (`min_c` and `max_c`).
     - Attempt to assign missing weights within the interval `[min_c, max_c]`.
     - If there aren't enough available weights within this interval, expand the interval outward minimally.
     - Keep track of used weights to ensure all weights are unique.
   - The total \( F(c) \) is the sum of all intervals' differences after assigning all weights.
   - If we can assign weights to all rabbits while maintaining the constraints, output `Yes` along with the complete weights; otherwise, output `No`.

4. **Implementation Details:**
   - Use priority queues or sorted lists to efficiently choose the next available weight that minimally expands the interval.
   - Keep a global set of used weights to avoid duplicates.
   - Be cautious of overlapping intervals when known weights of different colors are interleaved.
   - The solution must be efficient for up to \( T = 10^5 \) test cases with \( N \leq 300 \) rabbits each.

**Explanation:**

- We iterate over each test case and read the inputs.
- We collect the known weights and the indices of the rabbits with missing weights per color.
- We attempt to assign weights to missing rabbits per color group by:
  - Starting from the known interval `[min_c, max_c]`.
  - Expanding the interval outward by considering numbers just outside the current `min_c` and `max_c`.
  - Prioritizing assignments that minimally expand the interval to keep \( F(c) \) low.
  - Ensuring no weights are reused by keeping track of `assigned_weights`.
- If at any point we cannot assign a unique weight to a rabbit within the `(1, 10,000)` range, we mark the case as not possible.
- Finally, we output `Yes` and the assigned weights if possible, or `No` if not.

By thoroughly considering the constraints and implementing an algorithm that attempts to assign weights while keeping the \( F(c) \) as low as possible, we solve the problem efficiently within the given limits.
