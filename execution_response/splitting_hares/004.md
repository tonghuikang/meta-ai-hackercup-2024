**Key Findings:**

1. **Unique Weight Assignment:** Each rabbit must have a unique weight within the range [1, 10,000]. This requires careful selection of weights for rabbits with missing weights (`-1`) to avoid duplicates.

2. **Color Grouping Constraints:** No color should be assigned to exactly one rabbit. This means every color group must consist of at least two rabbits. If a color group initially has one rabbit and there are no missing weights for that color, it's immediately invalid.

3. **Minimizing Sum of F(c):** For each color group, `F(c)` is the difference between the maximum and minimum weights. To minimize the sum of all `F(c)`, it's optimal to assign missing weights as close as possible to existing weights within their respective color groups.

4. **Handling Missing Weights:**
   - **Colors with Known Weights:** For colors that already have one or more known weights, assign missing weights close to these known weights to minimize `F(c)`.
   - **Colors with All Missing Weights:** Assign the smallest possible available weights to these groups to keep their `F(c)` minimal.

5. **Ensuring Feasibility:** After assigning weights, verify that all constraints are met:
   - All weights are unique and within the specified range.
   - No color is assigned to exactly one rabbit.
   - The assignment minimizes the total `F(c)`.

6. **Edge Cases and Validation:** Be cautious with edge cases, such as when all weights are known but the color assignment doesn't satisfy the constraints or doesn't yield the minimal possible `F(c)`.

Based on these findings, the following Python code attempts to assign weights to the rabbits while adhering to all constraints.
