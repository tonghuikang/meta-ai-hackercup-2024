**Key Findings:**

To solve this problem, we need to determine if it's possible to assign unique weights to rabbits such that the given color assignments are valid and the sum of differences \( F(c) \) for each color \( c \) is minimized. Here are the critical steps and considerations:

1. **Color Group Constraints:**
   - Each color must be assigned to at least two rabbits.
   - The sum of \( F(c) = \text{max}(W_c) - \text{min}(W_c) \) across all colors should be minimized.

2. **Weight Assignments:**
   - All weights must be unique and within the range [1, 10,000].
   - Known weights must remain unchanged, and missing weights (denoted by `-1`) must be assigned appropriately without duplicating any existing weights.

3. **Minimizing \( F(c) \):**
   - To minimize the sum of \( F(c) \), weights within the same color group should be as close as possible.
   - This often translates to grouping consecutive or nearly consecutive weights under the same color.

4. **Assignment Strategy:**
   - **Sorting:** Start by sorting the rabbits based on their known weights.
   - **Grouping:** Group the sorted weights by their color assignments.
   - **Assigning Missing Weights:** For each color group with missing weights, assign the smallest possible unused weights that keep the group's weights as close together as possible.
   - **Validation:** After assignments, ensure all weights are unique, within the specified range, and that each color group has at least two rabbits.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - If any color group has only one rabbit, it's immediately invalid.
   - Ensure that the final set of assigned weights does not exceed the allowed range or create duplicates.

By systematically sorting, grouping, and assigning weights while adhering to the constraints, we can determine the feasibility of the given color assignments and provide a valid weight distribution if possible.
