**Key Findings:**

When solving the problem of assigning weights to rabbits with missing values while adhering to the given constraints, the following key points emerge:

1. **Grouping by Shirt Colors:**
   - **Organize Rabbits:** Group all rabbits based on their assigned shirt colors. This allows us to handle each color group separately.
   - **Check for Singleton Colors:** Ensure that no color is assigned to exactly one rabbit, as per the problem's constraints.

2. **Handling Known and Unknown Weights:**
   - **Separate Known and Unknown Weights:** Within each color group, distinguish between rabbits with known weights and those with missing weights (`-1`).
   - **Maintain Weight Uniqueness:** All weights must be unique and within the range `[1, 10,000]`. Keep track of already assigned weights to avoid duplicates.

3. **Minimizing the Sum of F(c):**
   - **Define F(c):** For each color group `c`, `F(c)` is the difference between the maximum and minimum weights of rabbits wearing that color.
   - **Assign Missing Weights Strategically:** To minimize the sum of `F(c)` across all colors, assign missing weights as close as possible to existing weights within the same color group. If no weights are known for a color, assign a contiguous block of unused weights.

4. **Assigning Weights:**
   - **Available Weights Pool:** Maintain a sorted list of available weights that are not already assigned to any rabbit. This facilitates efficient assignment of missing weights.
   - **Sequential Assignment:** For each color group, assign missing weights in a way that minimizes the range `F(c)` by placing missing weights adjacent to known weights or in the smallest available gaps.

5. **Validation:**
   - **Check Feasibility:** After attempting to assign missing weights, verify that all constraints are satisfied:
     - All weights are unique.
     - All weights are within the specified range.
     - No color group has exactly one rabbit.
   - **Output Results:** If it's possible to assign weights satisfying all constraints, output "Yes" along with the complete weight list. Otherwise, output "No".

By following this structured approach, we can efficiently determine whether a valid weight assignment exists and produce the appropriate output.
