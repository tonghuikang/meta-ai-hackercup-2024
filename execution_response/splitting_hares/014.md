**Key Findings:**

1. **Understanding Constraints:**
   - **Unique Weights:** All known weights are unique, and any assigned weights must also be unique within the range [1, 10,000].
   - **Shirt Color Assignment:** No shirt color is assigned to exactly one rabbit. Each color must correspond to at least two rabbits.
   - **Minimizing Sum of F(c):** For each color, \( F(c) = \text{max weight} - \text{min weight} \). The goal is to minimize the total sum of \( F(c) \) across all colors.

2. **Handling Missing Weights:**
   - **Assigning Weights:** For rabbits with missing weights (`-1`), assign weights such that:
     - They fill gaps within their assigned color group to minimize \( F(c) \).
     - They do not conflict with already assigned weights.
   - **Weight Range:** Ensure all assigned weights are within [1, 10,000].

3. **Algorithm Strategy:**
   - **Grouping by Color:** Group rabbits by their assigned shirt color.
   - **Sorting Known Weights:** Within each color group, sort the known weights to identify potential gaps for assigning missing weights.
   - **Assigning Sequential Weights:** Assign missing weights as close as possible to existing weights in their color group to minimize the range \( F(c) \).
   - **Global Weight Tracking:** Keep track of all assigned weights to prevent duplicates and respect the uniqueness constraint.

4. **Validation:**
   - **Uniqueness Check:** After assignment, ensure all weights are unique.
   - **Color Group Size:** Verify that no color group has exactly one rabbit.
   - **Range Compliance:** Confirm all weights are within the specified range [1, 10,000].

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Impossible Assignments:** If it's impossible to assign weights without violating constraints (e.g., not enough available weights to fill missing slots), output "No".
   - **All Weights Known:** If all weights are known, simply verify the shirt color assignment adheres to the constraints.

6. **Efficiency Considerations:**
   - Given the constraints (\( T \leq 10^5 \) and \( N \leq 300 \)), the solution must be optimized for time and space, utilizing efficient data structures and algorithms to handle large inputs within acceptable time limits.
