**Key Findings:**

1. **Optimal Grouping for Minimal Sum F(c):**
   - To minimize the sum of \( F(c) \) across all colors, rabbits assigned the same color should have weights as close as possible. This ensures the difference between the maximum and minimum weights within each color group is minimized.

2. **Handling Known and Unknown Weights:**
   - Known weights must remain fixed and unique. Unknown weights (`-1`) need to be assigned distinct values within the range [1, 10,000] that do not conflict with known weights.
   - Assigning unknown weights should be done in a way that these weights are as close as possible to the known weights within their respective color groups to maintain minimal \( F(c) \).

3. **Sorting and Partitioning:**
   - Sort all known weights and determine the optimal positions for assigning unknown weights within each color group.
   - Ensure that within each color group, the weights (including the newly assigned ones) form a consecutive sequence or are as tightly packed as possible to maintain the minimal possible range.

4. **Validation of Color Assignment:**
   - After assigning weights, verify that the sum of \( F(c) \) for the given color assignment matches the minimal possible sum. If it doesn't, the color assignment is invalid, and the answer should be "No".
   - Ensure that all assigned weights are distinct and within the specified range.

5. **Efficient Implementation:**
   - Given the constraints (especially with \( T \) up to \( 10^5 \) and \( N \) up to 300), the solution must be optimized to handle large inputs efficiently, possibly by pre-processing and using appropriate data structures for quick lookups and assignments.
