**Key Findings:**

1. **Validation of Color Assignments:**
   - Ensure that no color is assigned to exactly one rabbit. If any color violates this rule, the assignment is invalid.
   - All known weights must be unique. Duplicate known weights render the assignment invalid.

2. **Assignment Strategy to Minimize Sum of F(c):**
   - **For Colors with Known Weights:**
     - Assign missing weights as close as possible to existing weights within the same color to minimize the range \( F(c) \).
     - This involves finding the closest available weights just below the minimum or just above the maximum known weights for that color.
   - **For Colors without Known Weights:**
     - Assign the smallest available consecutive weights to ensure the minimum possible range, thereby minimizing \( F(c) \).

3. **Maintaining Weight Constraints:**
   - All assigned weights must be within the range \([1, 10{,}000]\).
   - Ensure that all weights (known and assigned) remain unique across all rabbits.

4. **Efficient Assignment Process:**
   - Utilize binary search (via the `bisect` module) to efficiently find and assign the closest available weights.
   - Keep track of available weights using a sorted list for quick insertion and removal operations.

5. **Final Validation:**
   - After assignment, ensure that all constraints are satisfied.
   - If successful, output the assigned weights; otherwise, indicate that the assignment is invalid.
