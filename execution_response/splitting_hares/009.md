**Key Findings When Solving the Problem:**

1. **Grouping by Colors:**
   - The first step is to group the rabbits based on their assigned shirt colors. Each group represents a set of rabbits sharing the same color.
   - Ensure that no color group contains exactly one rabbit, as per the problem constraints.

2. **Handling Known Weights:**
   - Collect all the known weights and ensure they are unique. Any duplication among known weights immediately invalidates the assignment.
   - Create a list of available weights within the range [1, 10,000] excluding the known weights. These weights will be used to assign to rabbits with missing weights (`-1`).

3. **Assigning Missing Weights:**
   - For each color group, if there are rabbits with missing weights, assign them weights as close as possible to the existing weights in the group to minimize the range `F(c)` (i.e., `max - min`).
   - If a color group has no known weights, assign the smallest available consecutive weights to minimize `F(c)`.
   - Ensure that assigned weights do not clash with weights from other groups and remain within the specified range.

4. **Ensuring Constraints:**
   - All assigned weights must be distinct and within the range [1, 10,000].
   - After assignment, verify that no color group has exactly one rabbit and that all weights are unique.
   
5. **Verification and Output:**
   - If it's possible to assign weights while satisfying all constraints, output "Yes" followed by the complete list of weights.
   - If any constraint is violated during the assignment process, output "No".

The approach involves a greedy assignment of weights, prioritizing the minimization of `F(c)` by assigning missing weights as close as possible to existing ones within each color group. This ensures that the sum of `F(c)` across all colors is minimized, adhering to the problem's requirements.
