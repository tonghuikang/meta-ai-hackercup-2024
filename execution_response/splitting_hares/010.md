**Key Findings:**

1. **Grouping by Color:**
   - **Objective:** Since each shirt color must be assigned to at least two rabbits, we first group rabbits by their assigned color.
   
2. **Handling Known and Unknown Weights:**
   - **Known Weights:** For rabbits with known weights, we track these weights and ensure no duplicates exist.
   - **Unknown Weights:** For rabbits with unknown weights (`-1`), we need to assign unique weights within the range `[1, 10,000]` that do not conflict with known weights.

3. **Minimizing \( \sum F(c) \):**
   - **Approach:** To minimize the sum of \( F(c) \) across all colors, we aim to assign weights as close as possible within each color group. This minimizes the difference between the maximum and minimum weights for each color.
   - **Strategy:** 
     - Assign the smallest available weights to color groups with missing weights, ensuring that within each group, weights are as clustered as possible.
     - Sort the color groups based on the number of missing weights and assign weights accordingly to maintain minimal \( F(c) \).

4. **Validation:**
   - **Unique Weights:** Ensure that all assigned weights are unique and within the specified range.
   - **Color Group Size:** Verify that no color is assigned to exactly one rabbit.
   - **Feasibility:** If it's impossible to assign weights while satisfying all constraints, output `No`.

5. **Implementation Considerations:**
   - **Efficiency:** Given the constraints (\( T \leq 10^5 \) and \( N \leq 300 \)), it's crucial to implement the solution efficiently, avoiding unnecessary computations.
   - **Data Structures:** Utilize appropriate data structures (e.g., sets for available weights) to optimize the assignment process.

Below is the Python implementation incorporating the above findings:

```python
import sys
import sys
def main():
    import sys
    import sys
    from collections import defaultdict

    T = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    for test_case in range(1, T + 1):
        N = int(sys.stdin.readline())
        W = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
        C = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
        
        color_groups = defaultdict(list)
        known_weights = set()
        unknown_indices = []
        for idx in range(N):
            color = C[idx]
            weight = W[idx]
            if weight != -1:
                color_groups[color].append(weight)
                known_weights.add(weight)
            else:
                color_groups[color].append(-1)
                unknown_indices.append(idx)
        
        # Check if any color has only one rabbit
        invalid = False
        for color, weights in color_groups.items():
            if len(weights) == 1:
                invalid = True
                break
        if invalid:
            print(f"Case #{test_case}: No")
            continue
        
        # Available weights
        available = set(range(1, 10001)) - known_weights
        available = sorted(available)
        
        # Assign weights to unknowns
        # Strategy: for each color with missing weights, assign the smallest available weights
        # to make the group as tight as possible
        assignment = {}
        possible = True
        # Sort colors by number of unknowns descending
        colors_sorted = sorted(color_groups.keys(), key=lambda c: color_groups[c].count(-1), reverse=True)
        for color in colors_sorted:
            group = color_groups[color]
            missing = [i for i, w in enumerate(group) if w == -1]
            if not missing:
                continue
            if len(available) < len(missing):
                possible = False
                break
            # Assign the smallest available weights
            for idx in missing:
                W_idx = unknown_indices.pop(0)
                W[W_idx] = available.pop(0)
        
        # After assignment, check all weights are unique and within range
        assigned_weights = set()
        for w in W:
            if w < 1 or w > 10000 or w in assigned_weights:
                possible = False
                break
            assigned_weights.add(w)
        
        if possible:
            print(f"Case #{test_case}: Yes")
            print(' '.join(map(str, W)))
        else:
            print(f"Case #{test_case}: No")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**Explanation of the Code:**

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases \( T \).
   - For each test case, it reads:
     - The number of rabbits \( N \).
     - A list of weights \( W \), where `-1` indicates an unknown weight.
     - A list of color assignments \( C \).

2. **Grouping Rabbits by Color:**
   - Utilizes a `defaultdict` to group weights based on their assigned color.
   - Tracks known weights to ensure uniqueness.

3. **Validation:**
   - Checks if any color group has only one rabbit, which violates the problem's constraints.

4. **Assigning Missing Weights:**
   - Identifies available weights (from `1` to `10,000` excluding known weights).
   - Sorts the available weights to assign the smallest possible values first, aiming to minimize \( F(c) \).
   - Assigns weights to rabbits with unknown weights, ensuring they are unique and within the valid range.

5. **Final Verification:**
   - After assignment, the code verifies that all weights are unique and within the specified range.
   - Outputs `Yes` along with the completed weights if assignment is successful; otherwise, outputs `No`.

**Note:** This implementation uses a greedy approach by assigning the smallest available weights to minimize the sum of \( F(c) \). Depending on specific test cases, more sophisticated strategies might be required to ensure the minimal sum, but this solution provides a viable starting point.
