**Key Findings:**

1. **Group-wise Weight Assignment:** To minimize the sum of \( F(c) \), each color group should have its weights as tightly packed as possible. For groups with known weights, assign missing weights within the range \([ \text{min\_weight}, \text{max\_weight} ]\). If the available slots within this range are insufficient, expand the range minimally to accommodate all group members.

2. **Uniqueness Constraint:** All weights must be unique across all groups. This necessitates careful management to ensure that assigned weights do not overlap between different color groups or with already known weights.

3. **Handling Missing Weights:** For color groups without any known weights, assign the smallest available unique weights to minimize \( F(c) \). If a group has known weights, prioritize filling in gaps within the existing range before expanding.

4. **Feasibility Check:** Before assignment, verify that there are enough unique weights available to satisfy all groups' requirements. If any group cannot be accommodated within the constraints, output `No`.

5. **Assignment Strategy:** Assign weights in a sorted manner to ensure minimal range expansions and to simplify the uniqueness checks. This involves iterating through color groups starting with those having the smallest possible ranges.

By systematically assigning weights while adhering to these principles, we can determine the feasibility of the given shirt color assignments and provide a valid weight distribution when possible.
