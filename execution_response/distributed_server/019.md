**Key Findings When Solving the Problem:**

1. **Understanding the Objective:**
   - **Goal:** Maximize the lexicographical minimum among all robot tray strings \( S_i \).
   - **Interpretation:** We aim to ensure that the "worst" (i.e., lexicographically smallest) tray string is as large as possible in lexicographical order.

2. **Robot Movement Constraints:**
   - Robots can move **right** or **down** or choose to **deactivate** each second.
   - No two robots can occupy the same cell at the end of any second.
   - Each move appends the lowercase version of the cell’s letter to the robot’s tray string.

3. **Strategy for Maximization:**
   - **Greedy Approach:** At each step, choose the highest possible character that allows all robots to continue building their tray strings without conflict.
   - **Prefix Construction:** Iteratively build the prefix of the minimum tray string by selecting the best possible next character that all robots can achieve.

4. **Handling Conflicts:**
   - When multiple robots aim to move to cells with the same character, ensure that their paths do not overlap.
   - Utilize backtracking or BFS to explore possible movements that satisfy the non-conflict condition.

5. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Consideration:**
   - Given the small grid size (\( R, C \leq 20 \)), a DP approach can be feasible.
   - DP can help in caching and reusing subproblem solutions, optimizing the search for the optimal tray strings.

6. **Implementation Steps:**
   - **Initialization:** Identify all active robots and their starting positions.
   - **Iteration:** At each step, determine the possible moves for each robot and select the move that maximizes the current character in the minimum tray string.
   - **Termination:** Continue until all robots are deactivated or reach the grid's boundaries.
   - **Result Compilation:** After all moves, determine the minimum tray string across all robots, ensuring it is lexicographically maximized.

7. **Edge Cases:**
   - Robots that choose to deactivate immediately contribute only their starting cell's character.
   - Ensuring that deactivating certain robots might lead to a better minimum tray string overall.

By meticulously applying these strategies, we can effectively determine the optimal movements for all robots to achieve the desired maximum lexicographical minimum tray string.
