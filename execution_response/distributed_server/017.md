**Key Findings:**

1. **Robot Path Selection:** Each active robot starts at a capitalized cell and can either deactivate immediately or move right/down at each step. The path chosen by each robot affects the final string `S_i`.

2. **Conflict Avoidance:** No two robots can occupy the same cell at the same time. This requires careful scheduling of robot movements to prevent collisions.

3. **Maximizing `min(S_i)`:** To achieve the lexicographically maximum `min(S_i)`, we must ensure that the smallest string among all `S_i` is as large as possible. This involves selecting paths for robots such that even the robot with the lexicographically smallest `S_i` has the largest possible string.

4. **Greedy Approach with Prefix Building:** Iterate character by character, choosing the highest possible character that can be appended to all robot strings without causing conflicts. This ensures that the minimum of all strings is maximized step by step.

5. **State Representation:** Use dynamic programming or BFS to represent the state of each robot, including their current positions and the strings they've built so far.

6. **Pruning and Optimization:** Given the grid size constraints (R, C â‰¤ 20), it's essential to prune invalid or suboptimal paths early to keep the solution efficient.

7. **Handling Deactivation:** Robots can deactivate at any step, which might be optimal if moving further would result in a lexicographically smaller string for that robot.
