**Key Findings:**

To solve this problem, we need to determine the lexicographically maximum possible value of the minimum `S_i` across all robot trays after they have traversed the grid. Here's a breakdown of the approach:

1. **Robot Identification**: 
   - Identify all robots by locating uppercase letters in the grid. Each robot starts at a specific cell with an initial string comprising its uppercase letter.

2. **Possible Paths for Each Robot**: 
   - For each robot, determine all possible paths it can take from its starting position to the bottom-right cell, moving only right or down. As the robot moves, it appends the lowercase version of each cell's letter it traverses to its string `S_i`.

3. **Conflict Avoidance**:
   - Ensure that no two robots are active on the same cell at the same time. This means that their paths should not intersect at the same time step.

4. **Lexicographical Maximization**:
   - The goal is to maximize the minimum `S_i` across all robots. To achieve this, we iteratively build the desired string character by character, selecting the highest possible character at each step that allows all robots to continue their paths without conflicts.

5. **Dynamic Programming and Pruning**:
   - Utilize dynamic programming to explore possible character sequences while pruning paths that cannot lead to a better solution than the current best.

6. **Efficient Search**:
   - Given the grid size constraints (up to 20x20), the solution needs to efficiently explore possible combinations of robot paths without exhaustive enumeration, possibly using memoization or other optimization techniques.

**Python Code:**

```python
import sys
import sys
import sys
def main():
    import sys
    sys.setrecursionlimit(10000)
    T = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    for tc in range(1, T+1):
        R, C = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
        G = []
        robots = []
        for r in range(R):
            line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()
            G.append(line)
            for c in range(C):
                if 'A' <= line[c] <= 'Z':
                    robots.append((r, c, line[c].lower()))
        # Since R and C are small, and number of robots limited, we can proceed
        # For each robot, find all possible paths from (r,c) to (R-1,C-1)
        # Each path corresponds to a string S_i
        # We need to choose a path for each robot such that at each time step,
        # no two robots are on the same cell
        # Then find the min(S_i), and maximize it lex order
        # Since it's complex, we'll approximate by choosing for each robot the lex smallest path
        # but since we need the max of min(S_i), we need to maximize the smallest S_i
        # One approach is to maximize the minimal S_i over all robots
        # We can try to find the smallest S_i, and maximize it
        # To simplify, assume that each robot selects the lex smallest path
        # Then take the max of these
        # But to match the sample, it's not straightforward
        # Alternative idea:
        # Find the common prefix that all S_i can have, and extend it as much as possible
        # Implement a BFS-like approach to build the prefix step by step
        # At each step, choose the maximum possible next character that all robots can achieve
        # given their possible moves
        # Implemented as follows:
        prefix = ""
