**Key Findings:**

1. **Robot Movement Constraints:**
   - Each robot can move either right or down or choose to deactivate.
   - Robots cannot occupy the same cell at the same time step, requiring careful path planning to avoid conflicts.

2. **String Construction for Robots:**
   - Each robot's string `S_i` starts with the letter in its initial cell (converted to lowercase) and appends the lowercase letters of the cells it visits.
   - The goal is to maximize the lexicographical minimum among all `S_i`.

3. **Greedy Approach for Maximizing `min(S_i)`:**
   - Build the target string character by character, always choosing the highest possible character that all robots can achieve at that position.
   - At each step, ensure that for each robot, there's a possible move (right/down) that allows its string to be at least the current target string.
   - Deactivate robots strategically to avoid conflicts and potentially improve the minimum string.

4. **Conflict Avoidance:**
   - Since robots cannot share cells at the same time, the algorithm ensures that chosen moves for all robots do not lead to overlapping positions in any time step.

5. **Efficiency Considerations:**
   - Given the grid size constraints (up to 20x20), the approach uses pruning and efficient state management to handle multiple test cases within acceptable time limits.
