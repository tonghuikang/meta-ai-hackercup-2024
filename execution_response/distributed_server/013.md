**Key Findings:**

1. **Objective Understanding:**
   - The goal is to maximize the lexicographical minimum (`min(S_i)`) across all robot trays after their movement sequences.
   - Each robot starts at a cell with an uppercase letter and builds its tray string by appending lowercase letters as it moves right or down.

2. **Initial Constraints:**
   - Each robot can either deactivate immediately or move right/down every second.
   - No two robots can occupy the same cell simultaneously after a move.
   - The grid size is relatively small (`R, C ≤ 20`), but the number of robots could be up to 400 (in the worst case where each cell has a robot).

3. **Strategic Approach:**
   - **Maximizing `min(S_i)`:** To maximize the minimum tray string, ensure that all robots have tray strings that are as large as possible lexicographically.
   - **Lexicographical Ordering:** The `min(S_i)` is determined by the smallest string among all robot trays. To maximize this, find the largest possible string that is less than or equal to all robot trays.
   - **Path Assignment:** Assign paths to robots such that the lexicographically smallest tray among all robots is maximized. This involves ensuring that each robot's tray string is above a certain threshold while handling movement constraints.
   - **Conflict Avoidance:** Since robots cannot collide, movement sequences must be carefully planned to avoid overlapping paths at the same time step.

4. **Implementation Considerations:**
   - **Dynamic Programming (DP) Approach:** Use DP to keep track of possible tray strings for each robot, ensuring that the minimal tray string across all robots is maximized.
   - **Priority Queues or Greedy Selection:** At each step, choose the next character that maximizes the minimum tray string, considering all robots' possible movements.
   - **Pruning:** Due to the potential state explosion (especially with many robots), implement pruning strategies to discard paths that cannot lead to a better `min(S_i)` than the current best.

5. **Complexity Management:**
   - Given the constraints (`R, C ≤ 20`), an optimized search or DP approach with effective pruning is feasible.
   - Focus on leveraging the grid's small size to explore all possible movements efficiently while managing robot interactions.

With these insights, the problem can be approached by iteratively building the tray strings for each robot, ensuring at each step that the minimum across all trays is maximized, and handling robot movements without conflicts.
