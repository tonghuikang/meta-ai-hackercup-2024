**Key Findings:**

To solve the problem, the goal is to maximize the lexicographically minimum string (`min(S_i)`) across all robot trays after they collect the snacks. The primary steps to achieve this are:

1. **Identify Robot Starting Positions:** Robots are initially placed on cells with uppercase letters. We need to identify all such starting positions.

2. **Compute the Lexicographically Maximum String for Each Robot (`S_i_max`):** 
   - For each robot, we determine the lexicographically maximum string it can form by moving only right or down.
   - This can be achieved using dynamic programming (DP). We traverse the grid from bottom-right to top-left, at each cell storing the maximum string that can be formed starting from that cell.
   - The DP relation is: 
     \[
     S_{\text{max}}[r][c] = \text{lower}(G_{r,c}) + \max(S_{\text{max}}[r+1][c}, S_{\text{max}}[r][c+1})
     \]
   - This ensures that at every step, the robot chooses the direction that results in the lexicographically larger string.

3. **Determine the Final Answer:**
   - After computing `S_i_max` for all robots, the answer for each test case is the lexicographically smallest string among all `S_i_max`. This ensures that the minimum across all robot trays is maximized.

4. **Handle Multiple Test Cases Efficiently:**
   - Given the constraints (up to 70 test cases and grid sizes up to 20x20), the DP approach ensures that the solution remains efficient.
