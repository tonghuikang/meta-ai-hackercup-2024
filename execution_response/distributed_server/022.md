When approaching this problem, several key insights are crucial:

1. **Understanding S_i Construction**:
   - Each active robot builds a string `S_i` starting with the lowercase version of its initial uppercase letter.
   - As robots move right or down, they append lowercase letters from the grid to their respective `S_i`.

2. **Objective**:
   - We aim to maximize the lexicographically smallest `S_i` across all robots. This requires ensuring that the minimum `S_i` is as large as possible in lex order.

3. **Strategy**:
   - **Binary Search on Possible Strings**: Since we're dealing with lexicographical order, we can perform a binary search on possible candidate strings to find the maximum possible minimum `S_i`.
   - **Feasibility Check**: For a given candidate string, we need to verify if all robots can achieve strings that are lexicographically at least as large as the candidate. This involves ensuring that each robot can follow a path that keeps its `S_i` not less than the candidate.

4. **Implementation Details**:
   - **Robot Paths**: Each robot has multiple possible paths (right or down). We need to explore feasible paths that satisfy the condition for the candidate string.
   - **Conflict Avoidance**: Robots cannot occupy the same cell at the same time. Hence, we need to ensure that paths chosen for robots do not lead to conflicts.

5. **Optimization**:
   - Due to the constrained grid size (up to 20x20), we can efficiently implement the binary search combined with the feasibility checks without exceeding computational limits.

Below is the Python implementation adhering to the above strategy:

```python
import sys
import sys
import sys
from collections import deque
from functools import cmp_to_key

def readints():
    return list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))

def main():
    T = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    for test_case in range(1, T+1):
        R, C = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
        grid = []
        robots = []
        for r in range(R):
            line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()
            grid.append(line)
            for c in range(C):
                if 'A' <= line[c] <= 'Z':
                    robots.append( (r, c, line[c].lower()) )
        # Now, robots: list of (r, c, S_i starting)
        # We need to find the max min(S_i)
        # Let's collect all possible S_i for each robot
        # But R, C <=20, number of robots <= 400
        # It's tricky. Instead, we'll define the min string to be as large as possible
        # We can perform a greedy approach: build the min string character by character
        # At each step, find the maximum possible character that can be the next character of the min string
        # Such that all robots can have their S_i >= current min string

        # To maximize the min S_i, we need to maximize the minimum S_i.
        # We can simulate building the min string step by step.

        # Initially, min_S = ""
        # At each step, find the maximum possible next character such that for each robot, there exists a path where S_i starts with min_S + next_char

        # To implement this, for each robot, we need to know the possible paths and their strings
        # But this is too slow. Instead, for each robot, find the lex maximum path.

        # However, to ensure that min(S_i) is maximized, it's equivalent to min(S_i) being as large as possible,
        # which depends on the robot with the smallest S_i.

        # Alternative Idea:
        # The min(S_i) is determined by the robot that has the lex smallest S_i.
        # To maximize this, we need to make sure that the robot with the lex smallest possible S_i is as large as possible.

        # So, to maximize the min(S_i), we need to maximize the lex smallest S_i across all robots.
        # This is similar to ensuring that the lex smallest string among all S_i is maximized.

        # To achieve this, we can find the lex smallest among the maximum paths for each robot.

        # For each robot, find the lex smallest S_i that it can achieve.
        # Then, the min(S_i) is the min over these.

        # But we want to maximize the min(S_i), so we need to assign paths to robots such that the minimal of their S_i is maximized.

        # Let's think differently: we want the min(S_i) to be as large as possible, so we need to ensure that all S_i >= K for some K,
        # and find the maximum K.

        # We can perform a binary search on possible K strings, and for each K, check if all robots can have S_i >= K,
        # ensuring no path conflicts.

        # However, implementing this requires handling path assignments with constraints, which is complex.

        # Instead, since R and C are small, and the number of robots is also small, we can proceed as follows:
        # For each robot, compute all possible S_i strings it can generate.
        # Then, find the min over all S_i, and find the maximum possible such min.

        # But even R=20, C=20, number of paths is too large.

        # Alternative Idea:
        # Since we want to maximize the min(S_i), we can perform a BFS where at each step, we choose the next character
        # to be as large as possible, ensuring that all robots can continue to have their S_i >= current prefix.

        # Implement the following:
        # Initialize prefix as empty string
        # While possible:
        #   For the next character, try 'z' to 'a':
        #       Check if all robots can have their S_i start with prefix + c
        #       If yes, set prefix += c and continue
        #       Else, try the next smaller character
        #   If no character can be added, break
        # The final prefix is the min(S_i)

        # To implement "all robots can have their S_i start with prefix + c",
        # for each robot, from its starting position, there exists a path where S_i starts with prefix + c.

        # This involves, for each robot, traversing its possible paths and ensuring at least one path has S_i >= prefix + c.

        # To optimize, for each robot, we can track the current position and the built string, ensuring it can reach prefix + c.

        # Implemented as follows:

        prefix = ""
        while True:
            found = False
            for next_c in reversed('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'):
                candidate = prefix + next_c
                ok = True

                    # The starting string for robot is s, which should match prefix + next_c
                    # So we need s starts with prefix, and the next character is >= next_c
