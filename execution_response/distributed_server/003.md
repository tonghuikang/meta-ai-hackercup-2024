**Key Findings:**

1. **Objective Clarification:** The goal is to determine the lexicographically maximum string `s` such that for every active robot, its tray string `S_i` is at least `s` in lexicographical order.

2. **String Construction Strategy:** To achieve this, we can iteratively build the string `s` one character at a time, selecting the highest possible character at each step that ensures all robots can still form tray strings `S_i` that are lexicographically greater than or equal to the current `s`.

3. **Robot Path Feasibility:** For each character addition, we must verify that every robot can follow a path from its starting position that results in a tray string matching or exceeding the current `s`. This involves using BFS to explore possible paths for each robot, ensuring that at each step, the robot can append the required character.

4. **Conflict Management:** Since no two active robots can occupy the same cell simultaneously after a move, it's essential to manage robot movements carefully to prevent conflicts. This might involve prioritizing certain paths or deactivating robots strategically when conflicts arise.

5. **Implementation Considerations:** Given the constraints (`R, C <= 20`), a BFS-based approach is feasible. We can precompute possible prefixes for each robot and iteratively build `s`, ensuring at each step that all robots can support the current prefix.

6. **Termination Condition:** The process continues until no further characters can be appended to `s` without violating the conditions for any robot, ensuring that `s` is as lexicographically large as possible while being a common lower bound for all tray strings.
