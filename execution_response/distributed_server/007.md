When approaching this problem, the key objectives and considerations include:

1. **Understanding Robot Movements and Constraints**:
   - Each active robot can move right, move down, or deactivate itself every second.
   - Robots cannot occupy the same cell simultaneously at the end of any second.
   - When a robot moves to a new cell, it appends the lowercase version of the cell's letter to its tray string.

2. **Maximizing the Lexicographical Minimum of Tray Strings**:
   - The goal is to maximize the minimum string (`min(S_i)`) across all robots in lexicographical order.
   - This involves ensuring that the smallest string among all `S_i` is as large as possible in lex order.

3. **Greedy Approach to Build the Desired Prefix**:
   - Iteratively build the desired minimal prefix by selecting the largest possible next character that allows all robots to extend their tray strings without violating movement constraints.
   - At each step, choose the highest possible character that can be appended while ensuring all robots can still follow a valid path.

4. **Conflict Management Between Robots**:
   - Ensure that robots do not move into the same cell at the same time, which would violate the constraints.
   - This requires careful tracking of robot positions and possible movements at each step.

5. **Dynamic Programming and BFS for Feasibility Checks**:
   - Use BFS to evaluate possible movements and string extensions for each robot.
   - Dynamic programming may be employed to store intermediate states and optimize the search for the optimal minimal string.

Below is the Python code that implements the above strategy to solve the problem:
