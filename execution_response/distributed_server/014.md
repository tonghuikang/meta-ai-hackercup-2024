**Key Findings:**

To solve the problem of maximizing the lexicographical minimum string (`min(S_i)`) across all robot paths on a grid, we adopt the following strategy:

1. **Prefix Construction:** We aim to build a common prefix `T` for all robots' strings `S_i`. At each step, we attempt to append the highest possible character to `T` such that all robots can continue their paths without violating the constraints.

2. **Robot Classification:**
   - **Required Robots:** These are robots whose current string `S_i` exactly matches the prefix `T`. They must append a character that is greater than or equal to the candidate character `c` to maintain `S_i >= T`.
   - **Optional Robots:** These robots already have `S_i > T` and can choose to either append any character or deactivate. Their actions do not affect the current prefix `T`.

3. **Bipartite Matching:**
   - For each candidate character `c` (starting from 'z' down to 'a'), we determine if all required robots can move to a new cell containing a character `>= c` without any two robots moving to the same cell.
   - This situation is modeled as a bipartite graph where one set represents the required robots and the other set represents potential target cells with characters `>= c`.
   - We use a standard bipartite matching algorithm to verify if a perfect matching exists. If it does, we append `c` to `T` and update the robots' positions accordingly.

4. **Iteration:** We repeat the above steps, successively building the prefix `T` until no more characters can be appended while satisfying all constraints.

5. **Termination:** The process stops when it's no longer possible to append any character to `T` such that all required robots can continue. The final `T` represents the lexicographically maximum possible `min(S_i)`.

This method ensures that all robots contribute to building the prefix `T`, and by iteratively choosing the highest possible character at each step, we maximize the lexicographical minimum across all robot paths.
