To solve this problem, I broke it down into manageable steps, focusing on the constraints and the goal to maximize the minimum value of the collected snack strings (`S_i`) across all robots. Here are the key findings from the problem-solving process:

### Key Findings:

1. **Movement Constraints Simplification**: Since robots can only move right or down and cannot revisit cells, their potential paths form a tree-like structure starting from their initial positions. This observation simplifies the potential paths each robot can take.

2. **Lexicographically Maximum Paths**: For each robot, the lexicographically maximum path can be determined by always choosing the move (right or down) that leads to a cell with the greater lexicographical value in the dynamic programming (DP) table.

3. **Dynamic Programming for Path Values**: We can precompute a DP table (`dp[r][c]`) for each cell representing the lexicographically maximum suffix starting from that cell. This DP table is computed using the formula:
   ```
   dp[r][c] = grid[r][c] + max(dp[r+1][c], dp[r][c+1])
   ```
   where `grid[r][c]` is the lowercase letter at cell `(r, c)`, and we compare the lexicographical values of the suffixes from the cell below and the cell to the right.

4. **Greedy Robot Selection**:
   - **Sorting Robots**: Robots are sorted in decreasing order of their `dp[r][c]` values (lexicographical maximum paths). This ensures we attempt to assign paths to robots that can achieve higher `S_i` values first.
   - **Path Assignment without Conflicts**: Starting from the robot with the highest `dp[r][c]`, we attempt to assign its lexicographically maximum path. We ensure that the path does not overlap with any previously assigned paths by keeping track of used cells.
   - **Maximizing Minimum `S_i`**: By assigning paths in this order, the minimum `S_i` among all assigned robots is maximized. This is because later robots have `dp[r][c]` values less than or equal to earlier ones, and any conflicts result in skipping the robot (thus not lowering the minimum `S_i`).

5. **Conflict Handling**: If a robot's intended path overlaps with an already assigned path, we skip that robot. This prevents any potential decrease in the minimal `S_i` value due to conflicts.

6. **Efficient Time Complexity**: Since each robot's path can be found in `O(R + C)` time and there are up to 400 robots (due to the grid size constraints), the total time complexity remains acceptable for the given constraints.

### Python Code:

```python
# Read the number of test cases
T = int(input())

for case_num in range(1, T + 1):
    R, C = map(int, input().split())
    grid = [input() for _ in range(R)]
    
    # Initialize dp table
    dp = [['' for _ in range(C + 1)] for _ in range(R + 1)]
    for r in range(R - 1, -1, -1):
        for c in range(C - 1, -1, -1):
            ch = grid[r][c].lower()
            right = dp[r][c + 1]
            down = dp[r + 1][c]
            dp[r][c] = ch + max(right, down)
    
    robots = []
    for r in range(R):
        for c in range(C):
            if grid[r][c].isupper():
                robots.append((dp[r][c], r, c))
    
    # Sort robots by their dp[r][c] in decreasing order
    robots.sort(reverse=True)
    
    used_cells = [[False] * C for _ in range(R)]
    assigned = []
    
    for si, r, c in robots:
        path = []
        cr, cc = r, c
        can_assign = True
        while True:
            if used_cells[cr][cc]:
                can_assign = False
                break
            path.append((cr, cc))
            used_cells[cr][cc] = True
            if cr == R - 1 and cc == C - 1:
                break
            ch = grid[cr][cc].lower()
            right_s = dp[cr][cc + 1] if cc + 1 < C else ''
            down_s = dp[cr + 1][cc] if cr + 1 < R else ''
            if right_s >= down_s:
                # Move right
                if cc + 1 >= C:
                    can_assign = False
                    break
                cc += 1
            else:
                # Move down
                if cr + 1 >= R:
                    can_assign = False
                    break
                cr += 1
        if can_assign:
            assigned.append(si)
        # If we cannot assign, mark the path cells as unused
        else:
            for cr, cc in path:
                used_cells[cr][cc] = False
    
    # The minimal S_i among assigned robots is the last one in the list
    if assigned:
        answer = assigned[-1]
    else:
        answer = ''  # No robots can be assigned (unlikely in given constraints)
    print(f"Case #{case_num}: {answer}")
