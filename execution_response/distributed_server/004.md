**Key Findings:**

1. **Objective:** We need to assign movement paths to multiple robots on a grid such that the lexicographical minimum of all robots' tray strings \( S_i \) is maximized.

2. **Tray Strings (\( S_i \)):** Each robot starts with the lowercase of its initial cell's character. As the robot moves right or down, it appends the lowercase of the visited cell's character to \( S_i \).

3. **Movement Constraints:**
   - Robots can move either right or down each second.
   - No two robots can occupy the same cell at the same time.
   - Robots can choose to deactivate at any step, finalizing their \( S_i \).

4. **Maximizing the Minimum \( S_i \):** To maximize the lexicographical minimum \( \min(S_i) \), we can construct the minimum string \( M \) character by character. At each step, choose the highest possible character that all robots can achieve at that position without violating movement constraints.

5. **Greedy Approach:**
   - Iteratively build the string \( M \) by selecting the lexicographically largest possible character at each position.
   - For each robot, maintain the set of possible positions it can reach, ensuring that all robots can continue to append characters that satisfy the current prefix \( M \).
   - Ensure that at every step, no two robots plan to occupy the same cell simultaneously.

6. **Implementation Details:**
   - Use BFS (Breadth-First Search) to explore possible movements for robots while respecting the constraints.
   - Represent the state of all robots using their current positions and the prefix \( M \).
   - Prune states where robots cannot contribute to maximizing \( \min(S_i) \).

Given these findings, the following Python code implements the solution:

```python
import sys
import sys
import math
from itertools import product
from collections import deque, defaultdict
import sys

def readints():
    return list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))

def main():
    T = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    for tc in range(1, T+1):
        R, C = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
        G = []
        robots = []
        for r in range(R):
            row = sys.stdin.readline().strip()
            G.append(row)
            for c in range(C):
                if 'A' <= row[c] <= 'Z':
                    robots.append( (r, c, row[c].lower()) )
        # Now, robots is a list of tuples: (r, c, initial_char)
        # We need to assign a path to each robot, moving right or down, possibly stopping at any step
        # Ensuring that at any time step, no two robots are in the same cell

        # To maximize the min(S_i), we need to maximize the lex min
        # We build the M string step by step, choosing the highest possible next character at each step
        M = ''
        # For each robot, keep track of possible paths as sets of positions with their current S_i
        # To simplify, for each robot, we can keep the current possible positions and their S_i
        # But it's too complex. Instead, since movement is deterministic (only right or down), for each robot, find the lex smallest path
        # But we need to maximize the min S_i, so likely need to find for each robot the lex largest possible S_i, and take min

        # Alternative approach: for each robot, find the lex smallest S_i it can achieve
        # Then the min of these is the min S_i, which we want to maximize
        # To maximize the min, we need to maximize the lex smallest S_i across robots

        # So to maximize the min(S_i), we need to make the lex smallest S_i as large as possible
        # One way is to perform a binary search on possible M and check feasibility

        # Let's collect for each robot all possible S_i strings it can generate
        # Given R and C <=20, and number of robots up to 400, but robots have limited paths
        # To make it efficient, for each robot, find the lex smallest and lex largest S_i

        # However, to maximize the min(S_i), we need all robots to have S_i >= M, and M as large as possible

        # Implement binary search on possible strings
        # Since the length of S_i can vary, let's assume the maximum possible length is R+C
        max_len = R + C
