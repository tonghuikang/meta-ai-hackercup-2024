**Key Findings:**

1. **Objective Understanding:**
   - The goal is to maximize the lexicographical minimum (`min(S_i)`) across all robot tray strings (`S_i`). This requires constructing a string `S` that serves as the smallest string among all `S_i` while making `S` as large as possible in lexicographical order.

2. **Robot Paths:**
   - Robots can only move right or down in the grid. Each robot's tray string begins with the lowercase version of its starting uppercase letter and appends lowercase letters from cells it visits.

3. **Iterative Construction of `S`:**
   - Start by identifying the lexicographically smallest starting character among all robots. This character initializes the string `S`.
   - At each subsequent step, determine the minimum possible next character (`min_c_i`) that each robot can append based on their current positions.
   - Choose the maximum character (`c_k`) from all `min_c_i` values to append to `S`. This ensures that `S` remains as large as possible while still being a prefix of all `S_i`.
   - Update the active robots' positions to those cells that contribute to the chosen `c_k`.
   - Repeat the process until no further characters can be appended without violating the constraints.

4. **Handling Deactivation:**
   - Robots that cannot append the next character based on the current `S` are effectively considered deactivated. However, since we're ensuring that `S` is a prefix for all active robots, deactivation doesn't affect the validity of `S`.

5. **Termination:**
   - The iterative process stops when it's no longer possible to append a character that satisfies the constraints for all active robots.

This approach ensures that the constructed string `S` is the lexicographically maximum possible value of `min(S_i)` across all robots.
