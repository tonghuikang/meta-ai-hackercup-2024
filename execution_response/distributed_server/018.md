**Key Findings:**

1. **Initial Robot Positions:** Identify the starting positions of all active robots by locating uppercase letters in the grid. Each robot starts with a string consisting of the lowercase version of its starting cell letter.

2. **Path Constraints:** Each robot can move either right or down at each step. Robots can also choose to deactivate, halting their movement permanently. Importantly, no two robots can occupy the same cell at the same time after any move.

3. **Objective – Maximizing `min(S_i)`:** The goal is to maximize the lexicographically smallest string among all robots' final strings (`min(S_i)`). This requires ensuring that all robots build their strings as lexicographically large as possible.

4. **Greedy Approach with Backtracking:** Implement a greedy strategy that iteratively builds the `min(S_i)` string character by character. At each step, choose the largest possible character that allows all robots to continue building their strings without conflicts. This involves checking all possible moves for each robot and ensuring no cell conflicts occur. Utilize backtracking to explore different move combinations when conflicts arise.

5. **Efficiency Considerations:** Given the constraints (`R, C ≤ 20`), a backtracking approach with pruning based on the current best `min(S_i)` is feasible. This ensures that the solution remains computationally efficient.

6. **Implementation Steps:**
   - Parse the grid and identify all robots.
   - Use backtracking to explore all possible move sequences, ensuring no conflicts.
   - At each recursion step, attempt to extend the `min(S_i)` string by selecting the highest possible character.
   - Keep track of the best `min(S_i)` found during the exploration.
