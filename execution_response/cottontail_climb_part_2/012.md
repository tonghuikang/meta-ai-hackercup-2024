**Key Findings:**

1. **Mountain Number Characteristics:**
   - **Odd Length:** Mountain numbers have an odd number of digits, specifically \(2k + 1\) digits for some integer \(k \geq 0\).
   - **Non-Zero Digits:** None of the digits can be zero.
   - **Monotonic Sequences:**
     - The first \(k + 1\) digits are monotonically non-decreasing.
     - The last \(k + 1\) digits are monotonically non-increasing.
   - **Unique Middle Digit:** The central digit must appear exactly once in the entire number.

2. **Range and Divisibility Constraints:**
   - **Range \([A, B]\):** The solution must efficiently handle large ranges up to \(10^{18}\).
   - **Divisibility by \(M\):** We need to count mountain numbers within the range that are multiples of \(M\), where \(M\) can be as large as \(10^9\).

3. **Algorithmic Approach:**
   - **Digit Dynamic Programming (DP):** Given the constraints, a digit DP approach is suitable to count valid numbers without enumerating all possibilities.
   - **State Definition:**
     - **Position:** Current digit position being processed.
     - **Tight Constraint:** Whether the current prefix matches the upper bound (`B`) or not.
     - **Increasing/Decreasing Phase:** Tracking whether we are in the increasing or decreasing part of the mountain.
     - **Last Digit:** The previous digit to ensure monotonicity.
     - **Middle Digit Information:** Ensuring the middle digit is unique by tracking its occurrence.
     - **Modulo State:** Current value modulo \(M\) to track divisibility.
   - **Memoization:** To optimize, memoize states based on the defined parameters to avoid redundant computations.
   - **Handling Large \(M\):** Since \(M\) can be up to \(10^9\), care must be taken to manage the size of the memoization table, possibly by limiting state parameters or optimizing storage.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Single-Digit Mountains:** All single-digit numbers (1 through 9) are mountain numbers.
   - **Zero Inclusion:** Since no digits can be zero, numbers like 0 or those containing zero are automatically excluded.
   - **Unique Middle Digit:** Ensuring the uniqueness of the middle digit is crucial and must be carefully handled in the DP transitions.

5. **Efficiency Considerations:**
   - **Pruning Invalid Paths:** Early termination in the DP when constraints are violated can significantly reduce computation.
   - **Modular Arithmetic:** Efficient computation of the modulo operation during number construction is essential to handle large numbers.

With these findings, the following Python code implements a digit DP solution to count the number of mountain numbers within a given range \([A, B]\) that are divisible by \(M\).
