**Key Findings:**

1. **Definition of Mountain Numbers:**
   - **Digit Length:** Mountain numbers have an odd number of digits, specifically \(2k + 1\) digits for some integer \(k \geq 0\).
   - **Non-zero Digits:** All digits must be from 1 to 9.
   - **Monotonic Sequences:**
     - The first \(k+1\) digits must be **monotonically non-decreasing**.
     - The last \(k+1\) digits must be **monotonically non-increasing**.
   - **Unique Middle Digit:** The central digit (middle digit) must appear exactly once in the entire number.

2. **Approach to Solve the Problem:**
   - **Precomputation of Mountain Numbers:**
     - Enumerate all possible mountain numbers up to \(10^{18}\) by iterating through all odd digit lengths (1, 3, 5, ..., 19).
     - For each length, generate valid sequences for the first and last \(k+1\) digits ensuring the monotonicity and uniqueness constraints.
     - Store all generated mountain numbers in a sorted list for efficient range queries.
   - **Handling Multiple Test Cases Efficiently:**
     - For each test case, perform binary searches to identify mountain numbers within the range \([A, B]\).
     - Count how many of these numbers are divisible by \(M\).
     - Since \(T \leq 95\) and the total number of mountain numbers is manageable (likely around a million), this approach remains efficient.

3. **Optimization Considerations:**
   - **Digit DP:** Although a digit dynamic programming approach could be considered, precomputing mountain numbers is more straightforward given the constraints.
   - **Efficiency in Counting Divisibles:** By precomputing and storing all mountain numbers, we can leverage Pythonâ€™s efficient data structures and algorithms (like binary search) to handle multiple test cases swiftly.
