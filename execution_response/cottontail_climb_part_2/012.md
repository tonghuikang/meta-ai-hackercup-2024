**Key Findings:**

To solve the problem of counting "mountain" numbers within a given range \([A, B]\) that are multiples of \(M\), the following approach is effective:

1. **Understanding Mountain Numbers:**
   - **Definition:** A mountain number has an odd number of digits \(2k + 1\) where \(k \geq 0\).
   - **Properties:**
     - All digits are non-zero.
     - The first \(k + 1\) digits are monotonically non-decreasing.
     - The last \(k + 1\) digits are monotonically non-increasing.
     - The middle digit is unique (appears exactly once in the number).

2. **Generating Mountain Numbers:**
   - **Digit Lengths:** Consider all possible odd lengths from 1 to 19 digits.
   - **Central Digit:** Iterate through each possible central digit (1 to 9).
   - **First Half Generation:** Generate all valid non-decreasing sequences for the first half, ensuring that no digit equals the central digit to maintain its uniqueness.
   - **Second Half Generation:** Generate all valid non-increasing sequences for the second half, again ensuring digits are strictly less than the central digit.
   - **Combining Sequences:** Concatenate the generated first half, central digit, and second half to form complete mountain numbers.

3. **Processing Test Cases:**
   - **Preprocessing:** Precompute and sort all possible mountain numbers.
   - **Query Handling:** For each test case, perform binary searches to find the range of mountain numbers within \([A, B]\) and then count how many of these are divisible by \(M\).

4. **Efficiency Considerations:**
   - The total number of mountain numbers up to \(10^{19}\) is manageable (likely around 1 million).
   - Precomputing all mountain numbers allows for efficient query processing using binary search and simple iteration for divisibility checks.

**Python Code:**

```python
import sys
import bisect
from itertools import combinations_with_replacement, product

def generate_mountain_numbers():
    mountain_numbers = set()
    
    # Lengths: 1,3,5,...,19

        k = (l - 1) // 2
        # Central digit from 1 to 9
        for c in range(1, 10):
            # Generate first k digits: non-decreasing, each < c
            if k == 0:
                first_parts = ['']
            else:
                # digits from 1 to c-1, non-decreasing
                # use combinations with replacement

                last_parts = ['']
            else:
                # digits from 1 to c-1, non-increasing
                # similar to first, but non-increasing
                last_digit_options = list(range(1, c))
                # To generate non-increasing sequences, generate combinations with replacement and sort in reverse
                last_combinations = combinations_with_replacement(last_digit_options, k)
                last_parts = [''.join(map(str, sorted(comb, reverse=True))) for comb in last_combinations]
            # Combine first_parts, central digit, last_parts
            for fp in first_parts:
                for lp in last_parts:
                    number_str = fp + str(c) + lp
                    number = int(number_str)
                    mountain_numbers.add(number)
    # Convert to sorted list
    mountain_list = sorted(mountain_numbers)
    return mountain_list

            A_str, B_str, M_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()
            A = int(A_str)
            B = int(B_str)
            M = int(M_str)
