**Key Findings:**

1. **Understanding Mountain Numbers:**
   - **Structure:** Mountain numbers have an odd number of digits, \(2k + 1\), where \(k \geq 0\).
   - **Digit Constraints:** No digit is zero; all digits range from 1 to 9.
   - **Monotonicity:**
     - The first \(k+1\) digits are non-decreasing.
     - The last \(k+1\) digits are non-increasing.
   - **Unique Middle Digit:** The central digit must appear only once in the entire number.

2. **Generating Mountain Numbers:**
   - **Length Consideration:** Since \(B\) can be up to \(10^{18}\), we need to generate mountain numbers up to 19 digits.
   - **Combinatorial Approach:**
     - For each possible length \(2k + 1\), iterate through possible middle digits \(c\) from 1 to 9.
     - **First Half:** Generate all non-decreasing sequences of length \(k\) where each digit is less than \(c\).
     - **Second Half:** Generate all non-increasing sequences of length \(k\) where each digit is less than \(c\).
     - **Uniqueness:** Ensure that the middle digit \(c\) does not appear in either half.
   - **Optimization:** Precompute and store all possible mountain numbers in a sorted list for efficient querying.

3. **Handling Multiple Test Cases:**
   - **Preprocessing:** Since the number of test cases \(T\) can be up to 95, precomputing mountain numbers allows reuse across test cases.
   - **Range Query:** For each test case, perform a binary search to find the range of mountain numbers between \(A\) and \(B\).
   - **Divisibility Check:** Iterate through the relevant subset and count how many are divisible by \(M\).

4. **Efficiency Considerations:**
   - **Storage:** The total number of mountain numbers up to 19 digits is manageable (likely in the order of millions), making it feasible to store and process.
   - **Computation:** Leveraging efficient combinatorial generation and binary search ensures that the solution runs within acceptable time limits.
