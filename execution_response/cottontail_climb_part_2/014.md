**Key Findings:**

1. **Understanding Mountain Numbers:**
   - A mountain number has an odd number of digits \(2k + 1\) where \(k \geq 0\).
   - All digits are non-zero.
   - The first \(k + 1\) digits are monotonically non-decreasing.
   - The last \(k + 1\) digits are monotonically non-increasing.
   - The middle digit appears exactly once in the entire number, ensuring its uniqueness.

2. **Generating Mountain Numbers:**
   - Iterate through all possible odd lengths (1, 3, 5, ..., 19) since \(B \leq 10^{18}\).
   - For each length, generate all possible combinations of non-decreasing sequences for the first half and non-increasing sequences for the second half.
   - Ensure the middle digit is unique by tracking its occurrence.

3. **Handling Multiple Test Cases Efficiently:**
   - Precompute and store all possible mountain numbers.
   - For each test case, use binary search to find the range of mountain numbers that lie within \([A, B]\).
   - Count how many of these are divisible by \(M\).

4. **Optimization Considerations:**
   - Since the number of mountain numbers is manageable (given the constraints), precomputing them is feasible.
   - Utilizing efficient search techniques like binary search ensures that each test case is processed quickly.

Below is the Python implementation based on these findings:

```python
import sys
import bisect

def generate_mountains():
    mountains = []
    # Generate mountains for all possible odd lengths up to 19 digits
    for n in range(1, 20, 2):
        k = (n - 1) // 2
        def backtrack(left, pos, current, last_digit):
            if pos == k + 1:
                # Now, determine the middle digit
                # It should be greater or equal to the last digit in left
                # Then, generate the right part which is non-increasing starting from middle
                for middle_digit in range(1, 10):
                    # Middle digit must be equal to current[-1]
                    if middle_digit != current[-1]:
                        continue
                    # Check uniqueness later
                    # Now generate the right part
                    def backtrack_right(right, pos_right, current_right, last_right_digit):
                        if pos_right == n:
                            # Now, build the number and check the uniqueness of the middle digit
                            number = int(''.join(map(str, current_right)))
                            if str(current_right[k]).count(str(current_right[k])) == 1:
                                mountains.append(number)
                            return
                        for d in range(1, last_right_digit + 1):
                            current_right.append(d)
                            backtrack_right(right, pos_right + 1, current_right, d)
                            current_right.pop()
                    current_right = list(current)
                    backtrack_right(current_right, k + 1, current_right, current[-1])
                return
            for d in range(last_digit, 10):
                current.append(d)
                backtrack(left, pos + 1, current, d)
                current.pop()
        backtrack([], 0, [], 1)
