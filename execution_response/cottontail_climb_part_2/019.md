When approaching this problem, several key observations and strategies can be employed to efficiently compute the desired count of mountain numbers within the specified range \([A, B]\) that are divisible by \(M\).

### Key Findings:

1. **Definition of Mountain Numbers**:
   - **Length Constraint**: Mountain numbers have lengths of the form \(2k + 1\) (i.e., 1, 3, 5, ..., up to 19 digits since \(10^{18}\) has 19 digits).
   - **Digit Constraints**: All digits are non-zero (digits range from 1 to 9).
   - **Monotonicity**:
     - The first \(k+1\) digits are monotonically non-decreasing.
     - The last \(k+1\) digits are monotonically non-increasing.
   - **Unique Middle Digit**: The central digit (the \((k+1)\)-th digit) must be strictly greater than its immediate neighbors, ensuring a unique peak.

2. **Challenge with Constraints**:
   - **Large Range**: \(A\) and \(B\) can be as large as \(10^{18}\), making it infeasible to iterate through each number in the range.
   - **Divisibility by \(M\)**: With \(M\) up to \(10^9\), tracking divisibility directly within a dynamic programming framework becomes memory-intensive.

3. **Efficient Solution Strategy**:
   - **Generate Mountain Numbers**: Instead of iterating through the range \([A, B]\), generate all possible mountain numbers up to 19 digits. Given the digit constraints, the total number of mountain numbers is manageable.
   - **Precompute and Sort**: Store these generated mountain numbers in a sorted list to facilitate efficient range queries.
   - **Binary Search for Range**: For each test case, perform binary searches to identify the subset of mountain numbers within \([A, B]\).
   - **Filter by Divisibility**: Iterate through the identified subset and count how many are divisible by \(M\).

4. **Optimization Considerations**:
   - **Avoid Redundant Computations**: Utilize memoization or iterative generation techniques to prevent redundant computations when generating mountain numbers.
   - **Efficient Divisibility Check**: Since generated numbers are sorted, and range queries are performed using binary search, filtering by divisibility can be done efficiently.

By following this approach, we can ensure that the solution is both accurate and performant, even with the stringent constraints provided.

### Python Solution:

```python
import sys
import bisect

def generate_mountain_numbers():
    mountains = []

    def build_number(left, peak, right_length):
        number = ''.join(map(str, left)) + str(peak) + ''.join(map(str, left[::-1]))
        mountains.append(int(number))

    def dfs(length, current, increasing, peak_set):
        if len(current) == length:
            if peak_set:
                number = int(''.join(map(str, current)))
                mountains.append(number)
            return
        start_digit = 1 if len(current) == 0 else current[-1] if increasing else 1
        for digit in range(1, 10):
            if len(current) < (length // 2) + 1:
                if len(current) == 0 or digit >= current[-1]:
                    dfs(length, current + [digit], True, False)
            else:
                if digit <= current[-1]:
                    if not peak_set:
                        # Ensure the peak is unique
                        if digit < current[-1]:
                            dfs(length, current + [digit], False, True)
                    else:
                        if digit <= current[-1]:
                            dfs(length, current + [digit], False, peak_set)
    
    for total_length in range(1, 20, 2):
        dfs(total_length, [], True, False)
    
    mountains = sorted(list(set(mountains)))
    return mountains

def main():
    mountains = generate_mountain_numbers()
    T = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    for tc in range(1, T+1):
        A, B, M = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
        left = bisect.bisect_left(mountains, A)
        right = bisect.bisect_right(mountains, B)
        count = 0
        for num in mountains[left:right]:
            if num % M == 0:
                count += 1
        print(f"Case #{tc}: {count}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Generating Mountain Numbers**:
   - The `generate_mountain_numbers` function systematically generates all possible mountain numbers up to 19 digits.
   - It ensures that each generated number adheres to the mountain number constraints:
     - **Monotonicity**: The first half of the digits are non-decreasing, and the second half are non-increasing.
     - **Unique Peak**: The central digit is strictly greater than its immediate neighbors.
   - Generated mountain numbers are stored in a sorted list to facilitate efficient range queries.

2. **Processing Test Cases**:
   - For each test case, the program reads the range \([A, B]\) and the divisor \(M\).
   - It employs binary search (`bisect_left` and `bisect_right`) to quickly identify all mountain numbers within the range \([A, B]\).
   - It then iterates through this subset to count how many numbers are divisible by \(M\).

3. **Optimizations**:
   - **Deduplication**: By converting the `mountains` list to a set and back to a sorted list, we ensure that all mountain numbers are unique.
   - **Early Termination**: By precomputing and sorting all mountain numbers, the program avoids unnecessary computations during each test case.

This solution efficiently addresses the problem constraints by leveraging precomputation, binary search, and optimized iteration techniques.
