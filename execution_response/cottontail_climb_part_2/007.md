**Key Findings:**

1. **Mountain Number Structure:**
   - A mountain number has an odd number of digits \(2k + 1\).
   - All digits are non-zero.
   - The first \(k + 1\) digits are monotonically non-decreasing.
   - The last \(k + 1\) digits are monotonically non-increasing.
   - The middle digit is strictly greater than its immediate neighbors, ensuring it's unique in the peak position.

2. **Enumeration Strategy:**
   - **For each possible length** (odd number of digits up to 19):
     - **Generate all possible peak digits** (from 2 to 9).
     - **Generate all valid left sequences** (non-decreasing sequences of length \(k\) with digits less than the peak).
     - **Generate all valid right sequences** (non-increasing sequences of length \(k\) with digits less than the peak).
     - **Combine left sequences, peak digit, and right sequences** to form complete mountain numbers.
   - **Single-digit numbers** (1-9) are also considered mountain numbers.

3. **Performance Considerations:**
   - The total number of mountain numbers is manageable (significantly less than a million), allowing precomputation.
   - **Precompute all mountain numbers** and sort them for efficient querying.
   - **For each test case**, use binary search to identify the range of mountain numbers within \([A, B]\) and count those divisible by \(M\).

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - Ensure that numbers with any zero digit are excluded.
   - Handle cases where \(A = 0\) appropriately, as numbers with zero digits are invalid.

The following Python code implements this strategy:
