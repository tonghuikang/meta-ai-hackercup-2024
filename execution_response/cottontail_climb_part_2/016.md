**Key Findings:**

1. **Mountain Number Definition:**
   - **Odd Length:** Mountain numbers have \(2k + 1\) digits, where \(k \geq 0\).
   - **No Zero Digits:** All digits must be from 1 to 9.
   - **Monotonicity:**
     - The first \(k + 1\) digits are non-decreasing.
     - The last \(k + 1\) digits are non-increasing.
   - **Unique Middle Digit:** The center digit must be strictly greater than its immediate neighbors to ensure the peak is unique.

2. **Constraints Analysis:**
   - **Range of Numbers:** Since \(B \leq 10^{18}\), the maximum number of digits is 19.
   - **Number of Test Cases:** With up to 95 test cases and \(M \leq 10^9\), efficiency is crucial.

3. **Solution Approach:**
   - **Precompute Mountain Numbers:**
     - Generate all possible mountain numbers up to 19 digits using a recursive approach.
     - Ensure that numbers adhere to the mountain criteria, especially the uniqueness of the middle digit.
   - **Efficient Lookup:**
     - Sort the precomputed mountain numbers to facilitate quick range queries using binary search.
   - **Handling Test Cases:**
     - For each test case, identify the subset of mountain numbers within the range \([A, B]\).
     - Count how many of these are divisible by \(M\).
     - Given the potential size of \(M\) (up to \(10^9\)), it's efficient to iterate through relevant mountain numbers and perform modulo operations on-the-fly.

4. **Optimization Considerations:**
   - **Memory Management:** Since the total number of mountain numbers is manageable (likely in the hundreds of thousands), precomputing and storing them is feasible.
   - **Time Efficiency:** Binary search ensures that range queries are performed in logarithmic time, and iterating through subsets for divisibility checks remains efficient.

5. **Implementation Steps:**
   - **Generate Mountain Numbers:** Use a recursive function to build mountain numbers by ensuring the first part is non-decreasing and the second part is non-increasing, with the middle digit being the peak.
   - **Sort and Store:** Collect all valid mountain numbers and sort them for efficient querying.
   - **Process Test Cases:** For each test case, determine the relevant mountain numbers within \([A, B]\) and count those divisible by \(M\).
