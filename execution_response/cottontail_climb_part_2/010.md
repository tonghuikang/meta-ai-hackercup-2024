**Key Findings:**

To solve the problem of counting "mountain" numbers within a given range \([A, B]\) that are divisible by \(M\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Understanding Mountain Numbers:**
   - **Definition:** A mountain number has an odd number of digits \(2k + 1\) where \(k \geq 0\). The first \(k+1\) digits are non-decreasing, the last \(k+1\) digits are non-increasing, all digits are non-zero, and the middle digit is unique within the entire number.
   - **Single-Digit Mountains:** For \(k = 0\), mountain numbers are single-digit numbers from 1 to 9.

2. **Generating Mountain Numbers:**
   - **Non-Decreasing Prefix:** For each possible length \(2k + 1\), generate all non-decreasing sequences of the first \(k+1\) digits. The last digit of this prefix is the middle digit \(D\).
   - **Non-Increasing Suffix:** Generate all non-increasing sequences of the last \(k\) digits such that none of these digits equal the middle digit \(D\). This ensures the uniqueness of the middle digit.
   - **Combining Prefix and Suffix:** Concatenate the prefix and suffix to form complete mountain numbers.

3. **Efficiency Considerations:**
   - **Precomputation:** Given that the maximum number of digits is 19, the total number of mountain numbers is manageable (approximately 100,000). We can precompute and store all mountain numbers in a sorted list.
   - **Binary Search:** For each test case, use binary search to find the range of mountain numbers within \([A, B]\) and then count how many of these are divisible by \(M\).

4. **Handling Multiple Test Cases:**
   - Since there can be up to 95 test cases, precomputing the mountain numbers ensures that we can efficiently handle each test case by simply querying the precomputed list.

5. **Implementation in Python:**
   - Utilize Python's `itertools` for generating combinations.
   - Use efficient searching methods like `bisect` to handle range queries.
   - Ensure that the final list of mountain numbers is sorted to facilitate quick searches.

**Python Code:**

```python
import sys
import itertools
import bisect

def generate_mountain_numbers():
    mountains = []
    for k in range(0, 10):
        l = 2 * k + 1
        if k == 0:
            # Single-digit mountain numbers
            for D in range(1, 10):
                mountains.append(D)
        else:
            # For each possible middle digit D
            for D in range(1, 10):
                # Generate all non-decreasing prefixes of length k with digits < D
                # Using combinations with replacement from 1 to D-1
                if D == 1:
                    # If D is 1, all prefix digits must be <1, which is invalid
                    continue
                # Generate non-decreasing sequences of length k from 1 to D-1
                for prefix in itertools.combinations_with_replacement(range(1, D), k):
                    prefix = list(prefix)
                    # Append the middle digit D
                    full_prefix = prefix + [D]
                    # Now generate non-increasing suffix of length k with digits <= D-1
                    # This is equivalent to non-decreasing sequences from 1 to D-1, reversed
                    suffix_sequences = itertools.combinations_with_replacement(range(1, D), k)
                    for suffix in suffix_sequences:
                        suffix = list(suffix)
                        # To make it non-increasing, reverse the non-decreasing sequence
                        suffix = suffix[::-1]
                        # Combine prefix and suffix
                        number_digits = full_prefix + suffix
                        # Convert digits to integer
                        number = 0
                        for digit in number_digits:
                            number = number * 10 + digit
                        mountains.append(number)
    mountains = sorted(mountains)
