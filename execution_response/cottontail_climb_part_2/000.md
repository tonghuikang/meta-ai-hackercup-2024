**Key Findings:**

1. **Mountain Number Structure:**
   - A mountain number has an odd number of digits \(2k + 1\).
   - No digit is zero.
   - The first \(k+1\) digits are monotonically non-decreasing.
   - The last \(k+1\) digits are monotonically non-increasing.
   - The middle digit must be unique in the entire number.

2. **Generation of Mountain Numbers:**
   - For each possible odd length from 1 to 19 digits, generate all valid mountain numbers.
   - Ensure the uniqueness of the middle digit by verifying it doesn't appear in the first or last parts of the number.
   - Use combinatorial approaches to generate non-decreasing and non-increasing sequences for the respective parts of the number.

3. **Efficiency Considerations:**
   - Precompute all possible mountain numbers (approximately \(10^5\) numbers) and sort them.
   - For each test case, perform binary search to identify the range of mountain numbers within \([A, B]\).
   - Iterate through the identified range to count how many numbers are divisible by \(M\).

4. **Handling Large Constraints:**
   - Since \(A\) and \(B\) can be up to \(10^{18}\) and \(T\) up to 95, optimizing the generation and searching process is crucial.
   - Precomputation combined with efficient searching ensures that the solution remains within acceptable time limits.

Below is the Python implementation encapsulating the above strategy:
