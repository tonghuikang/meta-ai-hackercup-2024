**Key Findings:**

1. **Understanding Mountain Numbers:**
   - **Definition:** A mountain number has an odd number of digits \(2k + 1\), where \(k \geq 0\). 
   - **Digit Constraints:** No digit is zero; all digits range from 1 to 9.
   - **Monotonic Criteria:**
     - The first \(k+1\) digits are monotonically non-decreasing.
     - The last \(k+1\) digits are monotonically non-increasing.
   - **Unique Middle Digit:** The central digit must be unique, meaning it doesn't repeat elsewhere in the number.

2. **Generating Mountain Numbers:**
   - **Iterate Over Possible Lengths:** For each odd length \(2k + 1\) (ranging from 1 to 19 digits), generate mountain numbers.
   - **Choose Peak Digit:** Select the middle (peak) digit \(D_{\text{peak}}\) from 2 to 9. It must be greater than its adjacent digits to ensure uniqueness.
   - **Generate Left and Right Sequences:**
     - **Left Side:** Generate all non-decreasing sequences of length \(k\) with digits less than \(D_{\text{peak}}\).
     - **Right Side:** Generate all non-increasing sequences of length \(k\) with digits less than \(D_{\text{peak}}\).
   - **Combine Sequences:** Concatenate the left sequence, peak digit, and right sequence to form a valid mountain number.

3. **Efficiency Considerations:**
   - **Precomputation:** Since the total number of mountain numbers up to 19 digits is manageable (on the order of tens of thousands), precompute and store all mountain numbers in a sorted list.
   - **Handling Multiple Test Cases:** For each query with range \([A, B]\) and divisor \(M\):
     - **Range Filtering:** Use binary search to efficiently identify mountain numbers within \([A, B]\).
     - **Divisibility Check:** Count how many of these numbers are divisible by \(M\).

4. **Implementation Steps:**
   - **Generate All Mountain Numbers:** Implement a function to recursively generate all valid mountain numbers based on the criteria.
   - **Sort the Generated Numbers:** This allows for efficient range queries using binary search.
   - **Process Test Cases:**
     - For each test case, determine the count of mountain numbers within the specified range that are divisible by \(M\).

**Explanation of the Code:**

1. **Sequence Generation Functions:**
   - `generate_non_decreasing_sequences`: Creates all possible non-decreasing sequences of a specified length where each digit is less than the peak digit. Utilizes `combinations_with_replacement` from the `itertools` module.
   - `generate_non_increasing_sequences`: Similar to the non-decreasing function but generates non-increasing sequences by reversing the non-decreasing sequences.

2. **Mountain Number Generation:**
   - The `generate_mountain_numbers` function iterates over all possible values of \(k\) to determine the number of digits.
   - For each valid peak digit, it generates all left and right sequences that meet the monotonicity and uniqueness criteria.
   - Each valid combination of left sequence, peak digit, and right sequence is converted into an integer and added to the `mountain_numbers` set to ensure uniqueness.
   - Finally, the set of mountain numbers is sorted for efficient querying.

3. **Handling Test Cases:**
   - The `main` function reads the number of test cases and processes each one.
   - For each test case, it uses binary search (`bisect_left` and `bisect_right`) to identify the subset of mountain numbers within the range \([A, B]\).
   - It then counts how many of these numbers are divisible by \(M\). An optimization is included: if \(M = 1\), all numbers in the range are counted without needing to check divisibility.
   - Results are printed in the required format.

4. **Efficiency Considerations:**
   - **Precomputation:** All mountain numbers are generated once and sorted, enabling fast range queries.
   - **Binary Search:** Utilizing the `bisect` module allows for \(O(\log N)\) range identification.
   - **Threading:** The `threading` module is used to prevent potential recursion limits and stack overflow issues for large inputs.

This implementation ensures that all constraints are met efficiently, even for the upper limits of the input sizes.
