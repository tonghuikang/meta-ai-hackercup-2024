**Key Findings:**

1. **Mountain Number Structure:** A mountain number has an odd number of digits \(2k + 1\). The first \(k+1\) digits are non-decreasing, and the last \(k+1\) digits are non-increasing. The middle digit must be unique, meaning it should be greater than both its immediate neighbors.

2. **Digit Constraints:** All digits in a mountain number are non-zero. Therefore, each digit ranges from 1 to 9.

3. **Number Lengths:** Since \(B\) can be up to \(10^{18}\), the maximum number of digits in a mountain number is 19 (as \(10^{18}\) has 19 digits). We need to consider all possible odd lengths from 1 to 19.

4. **Generation Strategy:** 
   - For each possible length \(2k + 1\), generate all possible combinations of digits that satisfy the mountain number conditions.
   - This involves selecting the first \(k+1\) non-decreasing digits and ensuring that the last \(k+1\) digits are non-increasing.
   - To ensure the middle digit is unique, it must be strictly greater than its adjacent digits.

5. **Efficiency Considerations:** 
   - Given the constraints, it's feasible to generate all possible mountain numbers upfront since the total number is manageable (considering the digit restrictions and lengths).
   - Once all mountain numbers are generated, they can be sorted to allow efficient range queries using binary search for each test case.

6. **Divisibility Check:** 
   - After identifying the mountain numbers within the range \([A, B]\), check which of these are divisible by \(M\).
   - To optimize, consider precomputing the modulus or leveraging properties of divisibility as needed.

7. **Handling Multiple Test Cases:** 
   - Precompute all mountain numbers once.
   - For each test case, perform range queries and count the divisible numbers without regenerating the mountain numbers.
