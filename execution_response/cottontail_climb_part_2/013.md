**Key Findings:**

1. **Mountain Number Definition**: A mountain number has an odd number of digits (2k+1), no zeros, and forms a "mountain" shape where the first k+1 digits are non-decreasing, the last k+1 digits are non-increasing, and the middle digit is unique (appears only once).

2. **Generation Strategy**:
    - **Length Handling**: Iterate through all possible odd lengths up to 19 digits (since \(10^{18}\) has 19 digits).
    - **Peak Digit Selection**: For each possible peak digit (from 2 to 9 for lengths greater than 1), generate all valid non-decreasing sequences for the first half and all valid non-increasing sequences for the second half using combinatorial methods.
    - **Uniqueness of Middle Digit**: Ensure that the peak digit does not repeat in the sequence by limiting the sequences to digits less than the peak.

3. **Efficiency**:
    - **Precomputation**: Generate all possible mountain numbers once and store them in a sorted list.
    - **Binary Search**: For each test case, use binary search to find the range of mountain numbers within [A, B].
    - **Divisibility Check**: Iterate through the relevant subset and count how many are divisible by M.

4. **Implementation Tools**:
    - **`itertools.combinations_with_replacement`**: Used to generate non-decreasing sequences efficiently.
    - **Binary Search (`bisect`)**: Efficiently finds the range of numbers within [A, B].
    - **Handling Large Numbers**: Since mountain numbers can be up to 19 digits, they are handled as integers.
