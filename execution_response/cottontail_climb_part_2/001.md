**Key Findings:**

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to count "mountain" numbers within a range \([A, B]\) that are multiples of \(M\). A mountain number of length \(2k + 1\) digits has the following properties:
   - Digits are from 1 to 9 (excluding zero).
   - The first \(k+1\) digits are monotonically non-decreasing.
   - The last \(k+1\) digits are the mirror of the first \(k+1\) digits and are monotonically non-increasing.
   - The middle digit is unique (does not repeat in the number).

2. **Generating Mountain Numbers**: Since numbers can be up to \(10^{18}\), we cannot iterate over all possible numbers. Instead, we generate all possible mountain numbers up to 19 digits (since \(10^{18}\) has 19 digits), adhering to the mountain properties.

3. **Recursive Generation Approach**:
   - For each possible length \(L = 2k+1\) (from 1 to 19), we generate sequences of digits.
   - We ensure the sequence is monotonically non-decreasing up to the middle digit.
   - The middle digit must be unique; we enforce this by requiring that the middle digit is strictly greater than the previous digit.
   - We mirror the first \(k\) digits to form the last \(k\) digits of the mountain number.

4. **Efficiency Considerations**:
   - The total number of mountain numbers generated is manageable (less than a million), so we can store them in a list.
   - We sort the list of mountain numbers to enable efficient range queries using binary search.

5. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**:
   - We precompute all possible mountain numbers once.
   - For each test case, we use binary search to find the mountain numbers within the range \([A, B]\).
   - We iterate over these numbers to count how many are multiples of \(M\).

6. **Constraints Management**:
   - Memory usage is acceptable due to the manageable size of the mountain numbers list.
   - Computation per test case is efficient enough given the constraints (\(T \leq 95\)).

7. **Edge Cases**:
   - For single-digit mountains (\(k = 0\)), we include digits from 1 to 9.
   - We carefully handle the uniqueness of the middle digit to ensure it doesn't repeat within the number.
