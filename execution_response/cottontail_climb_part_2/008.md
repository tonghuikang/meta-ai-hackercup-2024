**Key Findings:**

To solve the problem of counting "mountain" numbers within a given range \([A, B]\) that are multiples of \(M\), the following approach can be adopted:

1. **Understanding Mountain Numbers:**
   - **Length Constraint:** Mountain numbers have an odd number of digits, specifically \(2k + 1\) digits where \(k \geq 0\). This means the possible lengths are 1, 3, 5, ..., up to 19 digits (since \(B \leq 10^{18}\)).
   - **Digit Constraints:**
     - No digit is zero; all digits range from 1 to 9.
     - The first \(k+1\) digits must be monotonically non-decreasing.
     - The last \(k+1\) digits must be monotonically non-increasing.
     - The middle digit (the \((k+1)\)th digit) must be unique within the entire number.

2. **Generating Mountain Numbers:**
   - Since the maximum number of digits is manageable (up to 19 digits), we can generate all possible mountain numbers by iterating through each possible length.
   - For each possible length:
     - Determine the value of \(k\) (since length \(= 2k + 1\)).
     - Generate all sequences where the first \(k+1\) digits are non-decreasing and the last \(k+1\) digits are non-increasing.
     - Ensure that the middle digit is unique within the entire number.

3. **Efficient Generation and Checking:**
   - Utilize recursive or iterative methods to build valid mountain numbers digit by digit, ensuring that at each step, the constraints are maintained.
   - Keep track of the digits to ensure the uniqueness of the middle digit.
   - Prune the search space by stopping early if the current partial number cannot lead to a valid mountain number within the range \([A, B]\).

4. **Counting Multiples of \(M\):**
   - After generating all valid mountain numbers, filter them by checking whether they lie within the range \([A, B]\) and are divisible by \(M\).

5. **Optimizations:**
   - Precompute and store all mountain numbers, then for each test case, perform binary search to find the range \([A, B]\) and count the multiples of \(M\).
   - Alternatively, generate mountain numbers on-the-fly for each test case to save memory, especially since the number of mountain numbers is relatively small.

**Python Code:**

```python
import sys
from bisect import bisect_left, bisect_right

def generate_mountain_numbers():
    mountain_numbers = []
    
    # Possible lengths: 1,3,5,...,19
    for length in range(1, 20, 2):
        k = (length -1) // 2
        # Build first k+1 digits (non-decreasing)
        def build_first_digits(pos, current, last_digit):
            if pos == k+1:
                # Now build last k digits (non-increasing)
                # The middle digit is current[-1]
                middle_digit = current[-1]
                def build_last_digits(last_pos, last_current, last_dec_digit):
                    if last_pos == length:
                        # Ensure the middle digit is unique
                        if last_current.count(middle_digit) == 1:
                            number = int(''.join(map(str, last_current)))
                            mountain_numbers.append(number)
                        return
                    next_digit_start = 1
                    # To maintain non-increasing
                    for d in range(1, last_dec_digit+1):
                        build_last_digits(last_pos+1, last_current + [d], d)
                build_last_digits(k+1, current.copy(), middle_digit)
                return
            for d in range(last_digit,10):
                build_first_digits(pos+1, current + [d], d)
        
        build_first_digits(0, [], 1)
    
    mountain_numbers.sort()
    return mountain_numbers
