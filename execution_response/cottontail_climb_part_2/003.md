**Key Findings:**

To solve the problem of counting "mountain" numbers within a given range \([A, B]\) that are divisible by \(M\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Definition of Mountain Numbers**:
   - A mountain number has an odd number of digits (\(2k + 1\) for some integer \(k \geq 0\)).
   - None of its digits are zero.
   - The first \(k+1\) digits are monotonically non-decreasing.
   - The last \(k+1\) digits are monotonically non-increasing.
   - The middle digit is a unique peak (greater than its immediate neighbors).

2. **Approach**:
   - **Precompute All Mountain Numbers**: 
     - Given the constraints (\(A, B \leq 10^{18}\)), it's feasible to generate all possible mountain numbers up to 19 digits (since \(2k + 1 \leq 19\) for \(k \leq 9\)).
     - For each possible length \(n = 2k + 1\), generate mountain numbers by:
       - Selecting a middle digit \(d\) from 2 to 9.
       - Generating all possible non-decreasing sequences for the left side (first \(k\) digits).
       - Generating all possible non-increasing sequences for the right side (last \(k\) digits).
       - Combining these sequences with the middle digit to form complete mountain numbers.
   - **Sorting**:
     - Store all generated mountain numbers in a sorted list to facilitate efficient range queries.
   - **Processing Test Cases**:
     - For each test case, perform a binary search to identify the subset of mountain numbers within the range \([A, B]\).
     - Count how many of these numbers are divisible by \(M\).

3. **Efficiency Considerations**:
   - The total number of mountain numbers is manageable (around \(10^5\) to \(10^6\)), making this approach feasible within the given constraints.
   - Using Python's `itertools.combinations_with_replacement` helps efficiently generate non-decreasing and non-increasing sequences.

**Python Code:**

```python
import sys
import itertools
import bisect

def generate_mountain_numbers():
    all_mountains = []
    # n = 2k +1, k from0 up to9 (n<=19)
    for k in range(0, 10):
        n = 2 * k +1
        if n >19:
            break
        if k ==0:
            # single-digit mountains
            for d in range(1,10):
                all_mountains.append(d)
        else:
            # for k>=1
            for d in range(2,10):
                # Generate all non-decreasing sequences of length k with digits from 1 to d-1
                left_sequences = itertools.combinations_with_replacement(range(1, d), k)
                # Generate all non-decreasing sequences of length k with digits from 1 to d-1
                right_sequences = itertools.combinations_with_replacement(range(1, d), k)
                # Convert right_sequences to list since we need to iterate multiple times
                right_sequences = list(right_sequences)
                for left in left_sequences:
                    left_digits = list(left)
                    for right in right_sequences:
                        right_digits = list(right[::-1])  # non-increasing
                        # Combine left + [d] + right
                        digits = left_digits + [d] + right_digits
                        # Convert to integer
                        num = 0
                        for digit in digits:
                            num = num *10 + digit
                        all_mountains.append(num)
    # Sort all_mountains
    all_mountains.sort()
    return all_mountains

def main():
    all_mountains = generate_mountain_numbers()
    input = sys.stdin.read().split()
    T = int(input[0])
    idx=1
    for test_case in range(1, T+1):
        A = int(input[idx])
        B = int(input[idx+1])
        M = int(input[idx+2])
        idx +=3
        # Find the range of mountain numbers within [A,B]
        left = bisect.bisect_left(all_mountains, A)
        right_idx = bisect.bisect_right(all_mountains, B)
        count =0
        for num in all_mountains[left:right_idx]:
            if num % M ==0:
                count +=1
        print(f"Case #{test_case}: {count}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**Explanation of the Code:**

1. **Generation of Mountain Numbers**:
   - The `generate_mountain_numbers` function systematically generates all possible mountain numbers by iterating through possible lengths and middle digits.
   - For each valid length \(n = 2k + 1\), it:
     - Handles the single-digit case separately.
     - For longer numbers, it selects a middle digit \(d\) and generates all valid left and right sequences using `itertools.combinations_with_replacement`.
     - Combines the left sequence, middle digit, and reversed right sequence to form complete mountain numbers.
   - All generated numbers are stored in a list and sorted for efficient searching.

2. **Processing Input and Test Cases**:
   - The `main` function reads input, generates all mountain numbers, and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it uses `bisect` to quickly find the subset of mountain numbers within the range \([A, B]\).
   - It then iterates through this subset to count how many numbers are divisible by \(M\).

3. **Efficiency**:
   - Sorting the mountain numbers allows for quick range queries using binary search.
   - Precomputing the mountain numbers ensures that each test case can be processed rapidly without redundant computations.

**Usage:**

The Python script reads from standard input. Each test case consists of three integers: \(A\), \(B\), and \(M\). The script outputs the number of mountain numbers within the range \([A, B]\) that are divisible by \(M\) for each test case.

**Sample Input:**
```
6
121 121 11
0 100 2
0 132 1
121 132 1
121 131 1
22322 22322 1
```

**Sample Output:**
```
Case #1: 1
Case #2: 4
Case #3: 12
Case #4: 3
Case #5: 2
Case #6: 1
```
