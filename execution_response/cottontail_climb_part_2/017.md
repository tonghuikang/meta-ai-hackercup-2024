**Key Findings:**

1. **Mountain Number Definition**: A mountain number has an odd number of digits, no zeros, and its digits first non-decrease to a unique middle digit and then non-increase. The middle digit appears only once in the entire number.

2. **Generation Strategy**:
   - Iterate over possible lengths (1, 3, 5, ..., 19 digits).
   - For each length, determine the middle digit (`D_mid`) from 1 to 9.
   - Generate the first half (before the middle digit) as non-decreasing sequences from 1 to `D_mid - 1`.
   - Generate the second half (after the middle digit) as non-increasing sequences from 1 to `D_mid - 1`.
   - Concatenate these parts with the middle digit to form valid mountain numbers.

3. **Efficiency Considerations**:
   - Precompute all possible mountain numbers and store them in a sorted list.
   - For each test case, use binary search to find the range of mountain numbers within `[A, B]`.
   - Iterate through this subset to count how many are divisible by `M`.

4. **Implementation Details**:
   - Utilize Python's `itertools` to generate combinations with replacement for the first and second halves.
   - Ensure that the middle digit is unique by restricting the first and last halves to digits less than `D_mid`.
   - Optimize the search and counting process by sorting the mountain numbers and using efficient searching techniques.

Here is the Python code implementing the above strategy:

```python
import sys
import itertools
import bisect

def generate_mountain_numbers():
    mountain_numbers = set()
    # k from 0 to 9 (2k+1 digits from 1 to19)
    for k in range(0, 10):
        num_digits = 2 * k +1
        if k ==0:
            for d in range(1,10):
                mountain_numbers.add(d)
            continue
        for D_mid in range(1,10):
            # First k digits: non-decreasing from 1 to D_mid -1
            if D_mid ==1:
                continue  # No digits <1
            max_first = D_mid -1
            # Generate all combinations with replacement of k digits from 1 to max_first, non-decreasing
            # Equivalent to combinations with replacement
            first_combinations = itertools.combinations_with_replacement(range(1, max_first +1), k)
            # Similarly, last k digits: non-increasing from D_mid -1 to1
            last_combinations = itertools.combinations_with_replacement(range(1, max_first +1), k)
            # To make last k digits non-increasing, sort each last_combination in reverse
            # To save memory, process combinations on the fly
            first_list = list(first_combinations)
            last_list = [tuple(sorted(last, reverse=True)) for last in last_combinations]
            for first in first_list:
                first_str = ''.join(str(d) for d in first)
                for last in last_list:
                    last_str = ''.join(str(d) for d in last)
                    full_number = int(first_str + str(D_mid) + last_str)
                    mountain_numbers.add(full_number)
    # Convert to sorted list
    mountain_numbers = sorted(mountain_numbers)
    return mountain_numbers

    idx =1
    for _ in range(T):
        A = int(data[idx])
        B = int(data[idx+1])
        M = int(data[idx+2])
        test_cases.append( (A,B,M) )
        idx +=3
    # Generate all mountain numbers
    mountains = generate_mountain_numbers()
    # Sort them
    mountains = sorted(mountains)
    # For each test case, find the count
    for tc_num, (A, B, M) in enumerate(test_cases,1):
        # Find left and right indices
        left = bisect.bisect_left(mountains, A)
