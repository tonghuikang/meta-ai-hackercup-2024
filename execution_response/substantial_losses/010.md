**Key Findings:**

1. **Case When \( L = 0 \):**
   - You are not allowed to gain any weight. Therefore, the expected number of days to reach the target weight \( G \) is simply the difference \( W - G \).

2. **Case When \( L > 0 \):**
   - You can gain weight up to \( W + L \) units. The expected number of days to reach \( G \) in this scenario can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Expected Days} = (W - G) \times (2L + 1)
     \]
   - This formula accounts for the additional days required due to the possibility of gaining weight within the allowed limit.

3. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - All calculations are performed modulo \( 998{,}244{,}353 \) to handle large numbers efficiently and to conform to the problem's output requirements.

4. **Implementation:**
   - For each test case, check if \( L = 0 \). If so, output \( W - G \) modulo \( 998{,}244{,}353 \).
   - If \( L > 0 \), compute \( (W - G) \times (2L + 1) \) modulo \( 998{,}244{,}353 \).

Here is the Python code implementing the above logic:

```python
MOD = 998244353

T = int(input())
for tc in range(1, T+1):
    W_str, G_str, L_str = input().strip().split()
    W = int(W_str)
    G = int(G_str)
    L = int(L_str)
    diff = (W - G) % MOD
    if L ==0:
        ans = diff
    else:
        twoL_plus1 = (2 * L +1) % MOD
        ans = (diff * twoL_plus1) % MOD
    print(f"Case #{tc}: {ans}")
```
