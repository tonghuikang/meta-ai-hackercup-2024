To solve this problem, we analyze the expected number of days it takes to reach the target weight \( G \) from the current weight \( W \) under the given constraints.

**Key Findings:**

1. **Difference Calculation:**
   - Let \( d = W - G \). This represents the initial difference between the current weight and the target weight.
   
2. **Expected Days Formula:**
   - The expected number of days \( E \) to reach \( G \) from \( W \) considering the allowance \( L \) is derived as:
     \[
     E = d \times (2 \times L + 1)
     \]
   - This formula holds because each unit decrease towards \( G \) can potentially allow up to \( 2L + 1 \) movements to manage the constraint imposed by \( L \).

3. **Modulo Operation:**
   - Since the expected number of days can be a very large number, we compute \( E \) modulo \( 998244353 \) to keep the result within manageable bounds.

4. **Handling Large Inputs:**
   - Given that \( W \), \( G \), and \( L \) can be as large as \( 10^{18} \), it's crucial to perform operations in a way that handles large integers efficiently. Python's inherent support for big integers makes it suitable for this task.

5. **Final Computation:**
   - For each test case, calculate \( d = W - G \).
   - Compute \( E = (d \% \text{MOD}) \times ((2 \times (L \% \text{MOD}) + 1) \% \text{MOD}) \% \text{MOD} \), where \( \text{MOD} = 998244353 \).

The following Python code implements this logic efficiently:

```python
MOD = 998244353

def solve():
    import sys
    T=int(sys.stdin.readline())
    for tc in range(1,T+1):
        W,G,L=map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
        d=W-G
        e = (d % MOD) * ((2*(L % MOD) +1) % MOD) % MOD
        print(f"Case #{tc}: {e}")
```
