When solving this problem, the key insight is recognizing that the expected number of days to reach the target weight \( G \) from the current weight \( W \) depends on the difference \( D = W - G \) and the constraint \( L \). 

For each test case:
- If \( L = 0 \), the only possible action is to decrease weight by 1 each day. Therefore, the expected number of days is exactly \( D \).
- If \( L > 0 \), the scenario becomes a symmetric random walk with reflecting boundaries. The expected number of days can be derived to be \( E = D \times (2L + 1) \).

This formula aligns with the provided sample cases and efficiently handles the large constraints by avoiding simulation.

Here is the Python code implementing this logic:

```python
MOD = 998244353

def modinv(a):
    return pow(a, MOD-2, MOD)

T = int(input())
for tc in range(1, T+1):
    W, G, L = map(int, input().split())
    D = W - G
    if L ==0:
        p = D
        q =1
    else:
        p = D * (2*L +1)
        q =1
    # Since q=1, result is p modulo MOD
    result = p % MOD
    print(f"Case #{tc}: {result}")
```
