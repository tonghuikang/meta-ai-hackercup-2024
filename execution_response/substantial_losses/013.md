**Key Findings:**

1. **Understanding the Problem Constraints:**
   - We need to compute the expected number of days to reach a target weight \( G \) from an initial weight \( W \), where each day the weight can either increase or decrease by 1 unit with equal probability.
   - A strict rule is imposed: if the weight has ever been \( w \), it can never exceed \( w + L \) in the future.

2. **Special Cases:**
   - **When \( L = 0 \):** The weight cannot increase at all, so the only possible action is to decrease by 1 unit each day until reaching \( G \). Thus, the expected number of days is simply \( W - G \).
   - **When \( L > 0 \):** The expected number of days follows a specific pattern. For each unit difference \( D = W - G \), the expected days can be calculated using the formula for the sum of the first \( N = D + L \) natural numbers, which is \( \frac{N(N + 1)}{2} \).

3. **Formulating the Solution:**
   - **If \( L = 0 \):** The expected days \( E = D \).
   - **If \( L > 0 \):** The expected days \( E = \frac{(D + L)(D + L + 1)}{2} \).

4. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - Since the expected number of days can be very large (up to \( 10^{18} \)), we compute the result modulo \( 998{,}244{,}353 \).

5. **Implementation Steps:**
   - For each test case, compute \( D = W - G \).
   - Based on the value of \( L \), compute the expected days using the appropriate formula.
   - Output the result modulo \( 998{,}244{,}353 \).

**Python Code:**

```python
MOD = 998244353

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    T_and_cases = input().split()
    T = int(T_and_cases[0])
    for test in range(1, T +1):
        W, G, L = map(int, T_and_cases[3*(test-1)+1:3*(test-1)+4])
        D = W - G
        if L ==0:
            E = D % MOD
        else:
            N = D + L
            # Compute (N * (N +1) //2 ) % MOD
            # To prevent large numbers, compute N mod (2*MOD), since N*(N+1)//2 mod MOD
            N_mod = N % (2 * MOD)
            E = (N_mod * (N_mod +1) //2 ) % MOD
        print(f"Case #{test}: {E}")
