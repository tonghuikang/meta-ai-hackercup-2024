**Key Findings when Solving the Problem:**

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the expected number of days it will take to reduce the weight from an initial weight `W` to a goal weight `G` under given constraints.
   - Each day, with equal probability, the weight can increase or decrease by 1 unit, unless constrained.
   - The constraint is that if the weight has ever been `w`, it cannot exceed `w + L` in the future. If attempting to gain weight would violate this, the weight decreases by 1 unit instead.

2. **Modeling the Problem:**
   - The process can be modeled as a Markov chain or a symmetric random walk with reflecting barriers.
   - The minimum weight achieved so far (`min_weight`) affects the maximum allowed weight (`min_weight + L`).
   - The states of the random walk range from the goal weight `G` (absorbing state) to the maximum allowed weight.

3. **Deriving the Expected Time:**
   - Through analysis, it is found that the expected time to reach the goal weight `G` from the current weight `W` is given by the formula:
     \[
     \text{Expected Time} = (W - G) \times (2L + 1)
     \]
   - This formula accounts for the additional time incurred due to potential reflections at the upper boundary caused by the constraint `L`.

4. **Applying Modulus Operation:**
   - Since the result can be very large, we need to compute the expected time modulo \(998,\!244,\!353\).
   - To avoid overflow, we compute each part of the formula modulo \(998,\!244,\!353\) before multiplying:
     - Compute \(A = (W - G) \mod 998,\!244,\!353\)
     - Compute \(B = (2L + 1) \mod 998,\!244,\!353\)
     - Compute the final result \(E = (A \times B) \mod 998,\!244,\!353\)

5. **Verification with Sample Inputs:**
   - The formula has been verified against the sample inputs provided, and it produces the expected outputs.
   - For example, with \(W=201\), \(G=200\), \(L=1\):
     \[
     E = (201 - 200) \times (2 \times 1 + 1) = 1 \times 3 = 3
     \]
     Which matches the sample output.

**Python Code Implementation:**

```python
MOD = 998244353

T = int(input())  # Number of test cases

for case_num in range(1, T + 1):
    W_str, G_str, L_str = input().split()
    W = int(W_str)
    G = int(G_str)
    L = int(L_str)

    # Compute (W - G) % MOD
    A = (W - G) % MOD

    # Compute (2 * L + 1) % MOD
    B = (2 * L + 1) % MOD

    # Compute Expected Time E = (A * B) % MOD
    E = (A * B) % MOD

    print(f"Case #{case_num}: {E}")
```
