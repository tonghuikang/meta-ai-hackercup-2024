**Key Findings:**

1. **Problem Interpretation:**
   - The problem models a constrained random walk where the weight can either increase or decrease by 1 unit each day with equal probability.
   - A strict rule limits the weight such that if the weight has ever been `w`, it will never exceed `w + L` in the future.
   - The goal is to calculate the expected number of days to reach the target weight `G` from the current weight `W`.

2. **Expected Time Calculation:**
   - When `L = 0`, there are no constraints on increasing the weight, so the expected time is simply `W - G`.
   - When `L > 0`, the constraints enforce that the weight cannot exceed the minimal weight achieved so far plus `L`. Through analysis of smaller cases, it becomes evident that the expected time can be calculated using the formula `(W - G) * (2 * L + 1)`.

3. **Modulo Operation:**
   - The expected time can be a very large number, so it's crucial to compute the result modulo `998244353` as specified.
   - Since Python handles large integers efficiently, calculating `(W - G) * (2 * L + 1)` directly and then taking the modulo is feasible.

4. **Implementation Strategy:**
   - For each test case, check if `L` is zero. If so, the expected time is `W - G`.
   - If `L > 0`, compute `(W - G) * (2 * L + 1)`.
   - Finally, output the result modulo `998244353`.

Here is the Python code implementing the above logic:

```python
MOD = 998244353

T = int(input())
for test_case in range(1, T +1):
    W_str, G_str, L_str = input().split()
    W = int(W_str)
    G = int(G_str)
    L = int(L_str)
    if L ==0:
        E = (W - G) % MOD
    else:
        a = (W - G) % MOD
        b = (2 * L +1) % MOD
        E = (a * b) % MOD
    print(f"Case #{test_case}: {E}")
```
