To solve this problem, we need to determine the expected number of days required to reduce your weight from \( W \) to \( G \) under the given constraints.

**Key Findings:**

1. **Weight Difference (\( D \))**: Compute the difference \( D = W - G \). This represents the total units you need to lose.

2. **Expected Days Calculation**:
   - **When \( L = 0 \)**: The only possible action is to lose weight each day, resulting in an expected number of days equal to \( D \).
   - **When \( L > 0 \)**: The expected number of days is calculated as \( E = D \times (2L + 1) \). This formula stems from the constraints provided, ensuring you never exceed the specified weight limit based on your minimum weight so far.

3. **Modulo Operation**: Since the expected number of days can be very large, we compute the result modulo \( 998244353 \).

4. **Handling Large Inputs**: Python's inherent support for arbitrary-precision integers allows us to handle very large values of \( W \), \( G \), and \( L \) without overflow issues.

5. **Final Output**: For each test case, we output the expected number of days based on the above logic.

Here is the Python implementation based on these findings:

```python
MOD = 998244353

def solve():
    import sys
    T=int(sys.stdin.readline())
    for tc in range(1,T+1):
        W,G,L = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
        D = W - G
        if L ==0:
            E = D
        else:
            E = (2 * L +1) * D
        E = E % MOD
        print(f"Case #{tc}: {E}")
```
