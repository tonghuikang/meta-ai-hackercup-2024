**Key Findings:**

1. **Understanding the Process:**
   - You start at weight \( W \) and aim to reach \( G \) where \( G < W \).
   - Each day, your weight either increases or decreases by 1 unit with equal probability.
   - A critical constraint is that your weight should never exceed any previously recorded weight plus \( L \).

2. **Deriving the Expected Days (\( E \)):**
   - **When \( L = 0 \):**
     - You cannot gain any weight. Thus, you are forced to lose 1 unit each day.
     - The expected number of days is simply the difference between your current weight and goal: \( E = W - G \).
   - **When \( L > 0 \):**
     - The process becomes more involved, but it can be determined that the expected number of days is \( E = (W - G) \times (2L + 1) \).
     - This accounts for the additional flexibility allowed by the constraint \( L \).

3. **Modulo Operation:**
   - The final answer must be computed modulo \( 998{,}244{,}353 \).
   - Since the expected number of days (\( E \)) is either \( W - G \) or \( (W - G) \times (2L + 1) \), both expressions are straightforward to compute under modulo.

4. **Implementation Details:**
   - Given the large constraints (\( W, G, L \leq 10^{18} \)), the calculations should be optimized to handle big integers efficiently.
   - The expected days are always integers based on the derived formulas, so there's no need to handle fractions or modular inverses beyond the initial computation.

**Python Code:**

```python
MOD = 998244353

def solve():
    import sys
    T,*rest = map(int, sys.stdin.read().split())
    for i in range(1, T+1):
        W, G, L = rest[(i-1)*3: i*3]
        delta = W - G
        if L >0:
            term1 = delta % MOD
            term2 = (2 * (L % MOD) +1) % MOD
            E = (term1 * term2) % MOD
        else:
            E = delta % MOD
        print(f"Case #{i}: {E}")
