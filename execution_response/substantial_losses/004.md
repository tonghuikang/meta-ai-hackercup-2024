To solve this problem, the key observation is that the expected number of days to reach the goal weight \( G \) from \( W \) with the constraint \( L \) can be simplified to a linear formula. 

### Key Findings:

1. **Expected Value Formula:**
   The expected number of days \( E(W) \) can be derived as:
   \[
   E(W) = (W - G) \times (2L + 1)
   \]
   This formula effectively captures the number of steps required to reach from \( W \) to \( G \) while considering the constraint \( L \).

2. **Handling Large Numbers:**
   Given the constraints where \( W \), \( G \), and \( L \) can be as large as \( 10^{18} \), using Python's arbitrary-precision integers ensures that the calculations remain accurate without overflow issues.

3. **Modulo Operation:**
   Since the problem requires the answer modulo \( 998{,}244{,}353 \), the final result is computed using modular arithmetic.

4. **Edge Case (L = 0):**
   When \( L = 0 \), the expected number of days simplifies to \( W - G \), as you are forced to decrease your weight by 1 unit each day without any possibility of gaining weight.

With these findings, the implementation becomes straightforward.

```python
MOD = 998244353

T = int(input())
for tc in range(1, T +1 ):
    W, G, L = map(int, input().split())
    if L ==0:
        E = W - G
    else:
        E = (W - G) * (2 * L +1)
    print(f"Case #{tc}: {E % MOD}")
```
