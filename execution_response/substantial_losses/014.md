**Key Findings:**

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the expected number of days to reach a target weight \( G \) from an initial weight \( W \), considering a constraint \( L \) that limits how much the weight can increase beyond any previously achieved weight.
   - Each day, there's an equal probability of gaining or losing 1 unit of weight. However, if gaining would violate the constraint \( L \), a loss is guaranteed instead.

2. **Deriving the Formula:**
   - When \( L = 0 \), the expected number of days is simply \( W - G \), as you can only lose weight each day.
   - For \( L > 0 \), the expected number of days \( E \) can be derived as:
     \[
     E = (W - G) \times (2L + 1)
     \]
   - This formula accounts for the probability of gaining and losing weight while respecting the constraint imposed by \( L \).

3. **Modulo Operation:**
   - Since the expected number of days can be very large (up to \( 10^{36} \)), we compute the result modulo \( 998{,}244{,}353 \).
   - Given that the expected value \( E \) is an integer, and we're asked to output \( p \times q^{-1} \) where \( q = 1 \), the result simplifies to \( E \mod 998{,}244{,}353 \).

4. **Implementation Considerations:**
   - Python's arbitrary-precision integers allow us to handle very large numbers without overflow issues.
   - We process each test case independently, compute the expected value using the derived formula, and output the result modulo \( 998{,}244{,}353 \).

**Python Code:**

```python
MOD = 998244353

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    T = int(data[0])
    for i in range(1, T+1):
        W, G, L = map(int, data[3*(i-1)+1:3*i+1])
        k = W - G
        E = k * (2 * L +1)
        result = E % MOD
        print(f"Case #{i}: {result}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
