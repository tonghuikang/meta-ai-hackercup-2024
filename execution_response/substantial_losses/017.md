**Key Findings:**

1. **Understanding the Problem Dynamics:**
   - The problem involves a random walk where each day you can either gain or lose 1 unit of weight with equal probability.
   - A constraint is imposed such that your weight can never exceed the highest weight you've ever had plus a limit \( L \).
   - The goal is to compute the expected number of days to reach a target weight \( G \) from a current weight \( W \).

2. **Deriving the Formula for Expected Days:**
   - Let \( d = W - G \) denote the difference between the current weight and the goal weight.
   - When \( L = 0 \), you cannot gain any weight, so the expected number of days is simply \( d \).
   - For \( L > 0 \), each potential increase in weight introduces additional complexity. The derivation reveals that the expected number of days can be generalized as:
     \[
     \text{Expected Days} = d \times (2L + 1)
     \]
   - This formula accounts for the fact that with each unit difference \( d \), there's an increased number of potential paths due to the constraint imposed by \( L \).

3. **Handling Large Inputs Efficiently:**
   - Given the constraints where \( W \), \( G \), and \( L \) can be as large as \( 10^{18} \), it's crucial to compute the result modulo \( 998{,}244{,}353 \) to avoid overflow issues.
   - The formula ensures that computations remain manageable by breaking down the problem into multiplicative components that can be efficiently calculated under modulo.

4. **Implementing the Solution:**
   - The solution involves calculating \( d \) and \( 2L + 1 \), then multiplying these two values under modulo \( 998{,}244{,}353 \).
   - This approach guarantees that the result fits within the required constraints and adheres to the problem's specifications.

```python
MOD = 998244353

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    T_and_cases = input().split()
    T = int(T_and_cases[0])
    for tc in range(1, T+1):
        W_str, G_str, L_str = T_and_cases[3*(tc-1)+1:3*tc+1]
        W = int(W_str)
        G = int(G_str)
        L = int(L_str)
        d = W - G
        E = (d % MOD) * ((2 * (L % MOD) +1) % MOD) % MOD
        print(f"Case #{tc}: {E}")
