To solve this problem, we can model it as a constrained random walk. The critical insight is that when you have a constraint on how much your weight can increase above any previously attained weight, the state transitions become dependent on both your current weight and the maximum weight you've achieved so far.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Understanding the States**:
    - Let `W` be your current weight, `G` be your goal weight, and `L` be the maximum allowed increase above any previously achieved weight.
    - Define `N = W + L - G`. This represents the upper bound of your weight in this constrained random walk.

2. **Formulating the Expectation**:
    - If `L = 0`, you cannot gain any weight, so the expected number of days to reach `G` is simply `W - G`.
    - If `L > 0`, the expected number of days can be calculated using the formula:
      \[
      \text{E} = (W - G) \times (W + 2L - G)
      \]
    - This formula is derived from analyzing the recursive relationships of the expected number of days for each state in the random walk.

3. **Modulo Operation**:
    - Since the numbers can be very large, calculate the result modulo `998244353`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
    - Ensure that when `L = 0`, the formula defaults correctly to `W - G`.

Given this approach, the Python code below efficiently computes the expected number of days for each test case.

```python
import sys

MOD = 998244353

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    T, *rest = input().split()
    T = int(T)
    for tc in range(1, T+1):
        W, G, L = map(int, rest[(tc-1)*3:tc*3])
        if L ==0:
            E = W - G
        else:
            E = (W - G) * (W + 2 * L - G)
        E_mod = E % MOD
        print(f"Case #{tc}: {E_mod}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code reads the input, applies the appropriate formula based on the value of `L`, and outputs the expected number of days modulo `998244353` for each test case.

```python
import sys

MOD = 998244353

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    T, *rest = input().split()
    T = int(T)
    for tc in range(1, T+1):
        W, G, L = map(int, rest[(tc-1)*3:tc*3])
        if L ==0:
            E = W - G
        else:
            E = (W - G) * (W + 2 * L - G)
        E_mod = E % MOD
        print(f"Case #{tc}: {E_mod}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
