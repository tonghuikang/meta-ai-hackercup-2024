To solve this problem, we need to determine the expected number of days required to reduce your weight from \( W \) to \( G \) under the given constraints. Here's a breakdown of the key findings and the approach to solving the problem.

### **Key Findings**

1. **Difference Calculation (\( D \))**:
   - Let \( D = W - G \). This represents the initial difference in weight that needs to be overcome to reach the goal weight \( G \).
   
2. **Understanding the Constraint (\( L \))**:
   - The constraint \( L \) limits how much your weight can increase beyond the minimum weight achieved so far. Specifically, if you ever reach a weight \( w \), you cannot exceed \( w + L \) in the future.
   
3. **Expected Days Calculation**:
   - **When \( L = 0 \)**:
     - You are required to lose weight every day since any attempt to gain weight would violate the constraint. Therefore, the expected number of days to reach \( G \) is simply \( E = D \).
   - **When \( L > 0 \)**:
     - The expected number of days can be calculated using the formula:
       \[
       E = \frac{(D + L) \times (D + L + 1)}{2}
       \]
     - This formula accounts for the symmetry in weight gain and loss, ensuring that the constraint \( L \) is respected.
     - Since \( (D + L) \times (D + L + 1) \) is always even (as one of the two consecutive integers is even), the division by 2 yields an integer value for \( E \).

4. **Modulo Operation**:
   - Since the expected number of days can be very large (up to \( 10^{36} \)), we perform all calculations under modulo \( 998{,}244{,}353 \) to manage the size of the numbers.

5. **Final Output**:
   - For each test case, if \( L = 0 \), output \( E = D \) modulo \( 998{,}244{,}353 \).
   - If \( L > 0 \), compute \( E = \frac{(D + L) \times (D + L + 1)}{2} \) and output \( E \) modulo \( 998{,}244{,}353 \).

### **Python Implementation**

Below is the Python code implementing the above logic. The code efficiently handles large values of \( W \), \( G \), and \( L \) by leveraging Python's arbitrary-precision arithmetic.

```python
MOD = 998244353

def solve():
    import sys
    T = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    for tc in range(1, T+1):
        W, G, L = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
        D = W - G
        if L ==0:
            E = D % MOD
        else:
            N = D + L
            # Compute (N * (N +1)) //2 % MOD
            # To compute (N mod MOD) * ((N +1) mod MOD) * inv2 mod MOD
            N_mod = N % MOD
            N_plus1_mod = (N +1) % MOD
            inv2 = (MOD +1)//2
            E = (N_mod * N_plus1_mod) % MOD
            E = (E * inv2) % MOD
        print(f"Case #{tc}: {E}")
```

```python
MOD = 998244353

def solve():
    import sys
    T = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    for tc in range(1, T+1):
        W, G, L = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
        D = W - G
        if L ==0:
            E = D % MOD
        else:
            N = D + L
            # Compute (N * (N +1)) //2 % MOD
            # To compute (N mod MOD) * ((N +1) mod MOD) * inv2 mod MOD
            N_mod = N % MOD
            N_plus1_mod = (N +1) % MOD
            inv2 = (MOD +1)//2
            E = (N_mod * N_plus1_mod) % MOD
            E = (E * inv2) % MOD
        print(f"Case #{tc}: {E}")
```
