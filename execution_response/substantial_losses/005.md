To solve this problem, we need to compute the expected number of days it will take to reach the goal weight \(G\) from the current weight \(W\), given the weight change dynamics and constraints.

### Key Findings:

1. **Weight Dynamics:** Every day, with equal probability, the weight either increases or decreases by 1 unit. However, if gaining 1 unit would cause the weight to exceed the maximum allowed weight, the weight must decrease by 1 unit instead.

2. **Dynamic Maximum Weight:** The maximum allowed weight is dynamically determined. It's based on the minimal weight \(W_{min}\) ever achieved during the journey plus the limit \(L\). As you lose weight and \(W_{min}\) decreases, the maximum allowed weight \(W_{max} = W_{min} + L\) also decreases.

3. **Expected Time to Decrease Minimal Weight:** The expected time to decrease the minimal weight by 1 unit is constant and depends only on \(L\). By modeling the weight changes as a Markov process and solving the associated recurrence relations, we find that the expected time \(E(L)\) is \(2L + 1\).

4. **Total Expected Time:** The total expected time to reach the goal \(G\) from the starting weight \(W\) is the sum of expected times to decrease the minimal weight from \(W_{min}\) to \(G\). Therefore, the total expected time is \((W - G) \times (2L + 1)\).

5. **Modulo Operation:** Since the numbers involved can be very large (up to \(10^{18}\)), and the result needs to be modulo \(998,244,353\), we compute all intermediate results modulo this number to prevent integer overflow.

### Python Code:

Below is the Python code that implements the above algorithm:

```python
MOD = 998244353

def solve():
    T = int(input())
    for case_num in range(1, T+1):
        W_str, G_str, L_str = input().strip().split()
        W = int(W_str)
        G = int(G_str)
        L = int(L_str)
        delta = (W - G) % MOD
        coef = (2 * L + 1) % MOD
        ans = (delta * coef) % MOD
        print(f"Case #{case_num}: {ans}")
```

This code reads the number of test cases and, for each case, computes the expected number of days using the formula derived from our key findings. It performs modulo operations to ensure correctness with large numbers.
