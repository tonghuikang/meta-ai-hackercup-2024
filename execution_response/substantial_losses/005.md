To solve this problem, we first need to model the weight loss process described. Key findings and steps:

1. **Understanding the Random Walk Model:** The weight loss journey can be modeled as a symmetric random walk on integers, with the weight decreasing or increasing by 1 unit each day, but with constraints on maximum weight gain.

2. **Constraints:** The weight cannot exceed the highest weight achieved so far plus an allowance `L`. If increasing the weight would exceed this, you instead guarantee a weight loss of 1 unit.

3. **Reflecting and Absorbing Barriers:** Due to the constraints, the random walk has an absorbing barrier at the goal weight `G` (since you stop once you reach it), and a reflecting barrier at `W + L` (because you cannot go beyond it).

4. **Expected Time to Reach `G`:** Upon analyzing the random walk with these barriers, the expected number of days `E` to reach `G` from starting weight `W` is found to be:

   \[
   E = (W - G) \times (2L + 1)
   \]

   This equation accounts for the symmetrical movement around the starting weight and the additional constraint imposed by `L`.

5. **Special Case When `L = 0`:** When thereâ€™s no allowance for gaining weight (`L = 0`), you cannot gain any weight and must lose 1 unit each day. Therefore, the expected time simplifies to:

   \[
   E = W - G
   \]

6. **Modular Arithmetic:** Since the expected number could be very large, we need to compute it modulo \( 998,244,353 \).

7. **Final Answer Format:** Even though the problem mentions expressing the expected value as a ratio \( p/q \) and computing \( p \times q^{-1} \mod 998,244,353 \), in this specific scenario, the expected value is an integer (since \( q = 1 \)). Therefore, we can directly compute \( E \mod 998,244,353 \).

Now, here's the Python code to implement this:

```python
MOD = 998244353

def solve():
    T = int(input())
    for case_num in range(1, T+1):
        W_str, G_str, L_str = input().split()
        W = int(W_str)
        G = int(G_str)
        L = int(L_str)
        delta = W - G
        two_L_plus_one = 2 * L + 1
        E = delta * two_L_plus_one
        E_mod = E % MOD
        print(f"Case #{case_num}: {E_mod}")
```
