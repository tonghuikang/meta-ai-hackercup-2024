To solve this problem, we need to calculate the expected number of days it will take to reach a target weight \( G \) from the current weight \( W \), given the constraints on weight changes and the allowed maximum weight based on the parameter \( L \).

### Key Findings:

1. **Understand the Constraints:**
   - Each day, with equal probability, your weight either increases or decreases by 1 unit.
   - You're not allowed to exceed \( W + L \) units of weight at any point in time.

2. **Modeling the Problem:**
   - If \( L = 0 \), you can only decrease your weight by 1 unit each day, leading to an expected number of \( W - G \) days.
   - If \( L > 0 \), the problem can be modeled using a symmetric random walk with an absorbing boundary at \( G \) and a reflecting boundary at \( W + L \).
   - The expected number of days \( E(W) \) can be derived using the formula:
     \[
     E(W) = \begin{cases}
     W - G & \text{if } L = 0, \\
     2(W - G)L + L^2 & \text{if } L > 0.
     \end{cases}
     \]
   - This formula accounts for the expected time to reach the target weight while respecting the constraints imposed by \( L \).

3. **Implementation Considerations:**
   - Since the values of \( W \), \( G \), and \( L \) can be very large (\( 10^{18} \)), we utilize Python's arbitrary-precision integers.
   - The final result might need to be expressed as a fraction \( p/q \). However, in our scenario, the expected number of days \( E(W) \) is always an integer, so we can directly output \( E(W) \mod 998244353 \).

Here's the Python code that implements the above logic:

```python
MOD = 998244353

T = int(input())
for tc in range(1, T +1):
    W, G, L = map(int, input().split())
    if L ==0:
        E = W - G
    else:
        D = W - G
        E = 2 * D * L + L * L
    res = E % MOD
    print(f"Case #{tc}: {res}")
```
