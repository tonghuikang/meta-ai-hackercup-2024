**Key Findings When Solving the Problem:**

1. **Energy Transfer Chain Reactions:** When a moving stone collides with a stationary stone, it doesn't just stop; it transfers its remaining energy to the stone it collides with. This can create a chain reaction where multiple stones are pushed forward, affecting their final positions.

2. **Final Position Determination:** The final position of each stone depends on both its own energy and any additional energy it receives from collisions with subsequent stones. Accurately calculating these positions requires considering the cumulative effect of energy transfers.

3. **Efficient Processing Using a Stack:** To handle the energy transfers and update the final positions efficiently, a stack-based approach can be employed. By processing stones in the order they are thrown and using a stack to keep track of active stones, we can efficiently manage and update their positions without simulating each movement step-by-step.

4. **Handling Large Constraints:** Given the high limits for \( N \) (up to 300,000 per test case) and the total sum of \( N \) across all test cases (up to 2,000,000), it's crucial to design an algorithm with linear or near-linear time complexity to ensure performance within the constraints.

5. **Determining the Closest Stone to Goal:** After all stones have been processed and their final positions determined, iterate through the list of final positions to identify which stone is closest to the goal \( G \). In the case of a tie, the stone with the lower index should be chosen.

6. **Edge Cases and Validations:** Ensure that the algorithm correctly handles edge cases, such as stones ending exactly at the goal position or scenarios where multiple stones can end up at the same closest distance to the goal.
