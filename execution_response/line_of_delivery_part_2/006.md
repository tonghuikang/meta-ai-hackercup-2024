**Key Findings:**

To solve the problem efficiently:

1. **Final Position Calculation:** 
   - **Process in Reverse:** Start from the last stone and move towards the first.
   - **Assign Positions:** For each stone, its final position is the maximum of its energy `E_i` and one unit to the right of the position of the stone thrown after it.
   - **Ensure Non-overlapping:** This ensures that stones do not overlap and follow the energy transfer rules.

2. **Determine Closest Stone:** 
   - After calculating the final positions for all stones, compute the distance of each stone from the goal position `G`.
   - **Select the Closest Stone:** Choose the stone with the smallest distance. In case of a tie, select the stone with the lowest index.

3. **Efficiency Considerations:**
   - Given the large constraints, processing each test case in O(N) time by iterating backward and assigning positions accordingly ensures the solution remains efficient.

Below is the Python code implementing this approach:

```python
import sys
import sys
def main():
    import sys
    import sys
    sys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)
    input = sys.stdin.read().split()
    idx =0
    T=int(input[idx]);idx+=1
    for test_case in range(1,T+1):
        N=int(input[idx]);G=int(input[idx+1]);idx+=2
        E=[]
        for _ in range(N):
            E.append(int(input[idx]))
            idx+=1
        p=[0]*N
        # Assign from last to first
        p[-1]=E[-1]
        for i in range(N-2,-1,-1):
            p[i]=max(E[i],p[i+1]+1)
        # Find the stone closest to G
        min_dist = None
        min_idx = None
        for i in range(N):
            dist = abs(G - p[i])
            if min_dist is None or dist < min_dist or (dist == min_dist and i+1 < min_idx):
                min_dist = dist
                min_idx = i+1
        print(f"Case #{test_case}: {min_idx} {min_dist}")
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
