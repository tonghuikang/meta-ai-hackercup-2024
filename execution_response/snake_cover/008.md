**Key Findings:**

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We have an infinite 2D grid with a snake of length \( N \), initially placed horizontally facing east.
   - The snake performs \( M \) moves, each consisting of a direction change ('L', 'R', 'S') and a step count \( X_i \).
   - After each move, we need to compute the minimal area \( A(t) \) of the axis-aligned rectangle that can cover the snake's current position at each second during the move, and find the minimum of these areas \( f(i) \).
   - The final goal is to compute the sum of all \( f(i) \) for each test case, modulo \( 10^9+7 \).

2. **Constraints Analysis:**
   - High constraints: \( T \leq 10^5 \), \( M \leq 10^6 \), and \( N \leq 10^9 \), necessitate an efficient solution without simulating the entire snake.

3. **Efficient Approach:**
   - **Direction Management:**
     - Use a direction vector to track the current direction of the snake's head (north, east, south, west).
     - Implement direction changes based on 'L', 'R', or 'S'.
   - **Position Tracking:**
     - Instead of tracking all \( N \) cells, track the head's position and maintain the current bounds (min and max coordinates) of the rectangle covering the snake.
     - Since \( N \) is large, the snake will eventually occupy a path that affects the rectangle's dimensions based on its movement patterns.
   - **Area Computation:**
     - At any given time, the area \( A(t) \) can be computed as \( (max_x - min_x + 1) \times (max_y - min_y + 1) \).
     - The challenge is to compute the minimal \( A(t) \) during each move without iterating through every second.
   - **Optimizing for Minimum Area:**
     - Recognize patterns in the snake's movement to determine when the area could potentially decrease.
     - Use mathematical observations to compute the minimal area over each move's duration.
   - **Modular Arithmetic:**
     - Since the final sum can be very large, perform all additions modulo \( 10^9+7 \) to prevent integer overflow.

4. **Implementation Considerations:**
   - Precompute the direction changes and map them to coordinate movements.
   - Efficiently update the bounding rectangle's min and max coordinates based on the head's movement.
   - Avoid per-step simulation by leveraging arithmetic relationships and patterns in the snake's movement.
