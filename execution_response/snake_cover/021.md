**Key Findings:**

1. **Snake Representation:**
   - The snake is represented as a sequence of connected cells on a 2D plane. However, with \(N\) (up to \(10^9\)) being the length of the snake, it's impractical to track each cell individually.
   - Instead, we can model the snake's movement by tracking the head's path and maintaining the positions that affect the bounding rectangle.

2. **Direction Management:**
   - The snake can face one of four directions: North, East, South, or West.
   - Each turn ('L', 'R', 'S') changes the current direction accordingly.
   - We can represent directions as vectors or using enumeration to simplify direction updates.

3. **Bounding Rectangle Calculation:**
   - The axis-aligned bounding rectangle is determined by the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates occupied by the snake at any time.
   - To compute \(A(t)\), we need to track the positions of the head and the tail, considering the snake's length \(N\).
   - Since the snake moves in a FIFO manner, we can use queues or similar data structures to manage the positions affecting the bounding rectangle.

4. **Efficient Computation of \(f(i)\):**
   - For each move, instead of simulating each second, we can identify the moments when the bounding rectangle changes.
   - The minimum area within a move can be determined by examining these key moments rather than every single time step.
   - This optimization is crucial given the large constraints (\(M\) up to \(10^6\), \(X_i\) up to \(10^9\)).

5. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - Since the final answer requires modulo \(1{,}000{,}000{,}007\), it's essential to perform modular operations during accumulation to prevent integer overflows.

6. **Handling Large Inputs:**
   - Given the high constraints, it's vital to optimize both time and space complexity.
   - Avoiding unnecessary data storage and using efficient data structures (like deque for operations on both ends) will help manage memory usage.

7. **Initial Snake Position:**
   - Initially, the snake is horizontal, facing East. This means the head is at position \((0, 0)\), and the body extends to the West.

8. **Time Management:**
   - Keep track of the current time and update it as the snake slithers.
   - Ensure that the calculations of \(f(i)\) are correctly aligned with the time intervals of each move.

        # Since N can be up to 1e9, it's not feasible to track the tail's exact position
        # Instead, we can realize that the minimal area occurs when the snake is in a straight line
        # or has minimal deviations.

        # However, due to complexity, alternatively, we can consider that the minimal area possible
        # during a move is when the snake is aligning in minimal width and height.
