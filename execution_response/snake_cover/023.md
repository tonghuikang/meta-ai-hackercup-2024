**Key Findings:**

To efficiently solve the problem given the large constraints, the following strategies are essential:

1. **Direction Tracking:** Maintain the current direction of the snake's head. Since the snake can turn left, right, or continue straight, updating the direction based on each move is crucial.

2. **Position Tracking:** Instead of tracking each of the \( N \) cells individually (which is infeasible due to \( N \) being up to \( 10^9 \)), track the head’s position and model the tail's position based on the total movement. This approach leverages the fact that the snake's tail follows the head with a delay equivalent to the snake's length.

3. **Bounding Rectangle Calculation:** Keep track of the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates that the snake's head and tail can reach. Since the snake is always connected and moves in a grid, the smallest axis-aligned rectangle covering the snake can be determined by these minima and maxima.

4. **Sliding Window for Minimum Area:** For each move, determine the area of the bounding rectangle at each second during the move and find the minimum area within that interval. Given the snake’s movement patterns, this can often be optimized by understanding how the rectangle's dimensions change over time.

5. **Modulo Operation:** Since the sum of \( f(i) \) can be very large, compute the sum modulo \( 1{,}000{,}000{,}007 \) to keep the numbers manageable and adhere to the problem's constraints.

By implementing these strategies, we can handle each test case efficiently within the given time and space constraints.
