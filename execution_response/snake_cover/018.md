When solving this problem, several key observations and strategies are essential to handle the large constraints efficiently:

1. **Snake Representation**: Instead of tracking each cell of the snake individually (which is infeasible due to large `N` and `X_i`), we focus on tracking the bounding rectangle's extremities: minimum and maximum `x` and `y` coordinates (`min_x`, `max_x`, `min_y`, `max_y`). The area of this rectangle (`A(t)`) is `(max_x - min_x + 1) * (max_y - min_y + 1)`.

2. **Direction Handling**: The snake's movement direction (north, east, south, west) changes based on the turns (`L`, `R`, `S`). We can represent directions numerically and update them accordingly when processing each move.

3. **Head and Tail Tracking**: The snake's head moves forward based on the current direction, while the tail follows `N` steps behind. To efficiently track the tail's movement without simulating each step, we use a queue or a similar data structure to record directional moves and their extents. This allows us to determine how the bounding box changes as both the head and tail move.

4. **Bounding Box Updates**: For each move, we determine how the head's movement affects the bounding box. Simultaneously, as the tail moves, it may also affect the bounding box (possibly reducing its size). The minimal area `f(i)` for each move is the smallest area encountered during the entire duration of that move.

5. **Efficiency**: Given the high constraints (`T` up to `10^5` and `M` up to `10^6`), the solution must process each move in constant or logarithmic time. This is achieved by maintaining and updating the bounding box and direction efficiently without per-unit simulation.

6. **Modulo Operation**: Since the final answer can be large, all computations are done modulo `1,000,000,007` to prevent integer overflow and conform to the problem's requirements.

Below is the Python implementation encapsulating the above strategy:
