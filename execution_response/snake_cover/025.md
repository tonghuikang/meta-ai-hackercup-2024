**Key Findings:**

1. **Snake Representation:** The snake consists of \( N \) connected cells on an infinite 2D grid. Due to the potentially large \( N \) (up to \( 10^9 \)), it's impractical to track each cell individually.

2. **Movement Patterns:** The snake moves based on \( M \) commands, each involving a direction change (left, right, or straight) followed by a forward movement of \( X_i \) units. The direction of the snake's head determines its movement.

3. **Bounding Rectangle Area \( A(t) \):** For each time \( t \), \( A(t) \) represents the area of the smallest axis-aligned rectangle covering all \( N \) cells of the snake. Since multiple cells can overlap, the rectangle's area depends on the span of the snake's current position.

4. **Minimum Area During Moves:** For each move \( i \), we need to find \( f(i) \), the minimum \( A(t) \) during the interval of that move. This requires efficiently tracking how the bounding rectangle's area changes as the snake moves.

5. **Efficient Computation:** Given the constraints (\( T \leq 10^5 \), \( M \leq 10^6 \)), an efficient algorithm is necessary. We can model the snake's movement by tracking the head's position and direction, updating the bounding rectangle's extrema (min and max \( x \) and \( y \)) as the snake moves.

6. **Modulo Operation:** Since the final sum can be large, all calculations should be done modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) to prevent integer overflow and meet output requirements.

Based on these findings, the solution involves simulating the snake's movements by tracking direction changes and updating the bounding rectangle's boundaries to determine \( A(t) \) efficiently for each move.
