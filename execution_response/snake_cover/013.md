**Key Findings:**

1. **Movement Representation:** The snake's movement can be represented as a sequence of directional segments (north, east, south, west). Each move involves a possible direction change followed by multiple steps in that direction.

2. **Head and Tail Tracking:** To determine the area covering the snake, we need to track the positions of both the head and the tail. The head moves forward based on the current direction, while the tail follows the head after `N` steps.

3. **Efficient Area Calculation:** Given the large constraints (`N` and `X_i` up to \(10^9\) and `M` up to \(10^6\)), it's impractical to simulate each step. Instead, the solution involves tracking the cumulative movement and calculating the bounding rectangle's area by maintaining the minimum and maximum `x` and `y` coordinates over the relevant window of the snake's body.

4. **Sliding Window Technique:** By using a sliding window approach, we can efficiently update the minimum and maximum coordinates as the head moves forward and the tail progresses, ensuring that we always have the current bounding rectangle's dimensions.

5. **Direction Handling:** The snake can turn left, right, or continue straight. Proper handling of direction changes is crucial to accurately track the snake's path and update the bounding rectangle accordingly.

6. **Modular Arithmetic:** Since the final sum can be very large, all calculations should be performed modulo \(1{,}000{,}000{,}007\) to prevent integer overflow issues.
