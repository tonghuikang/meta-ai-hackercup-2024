To solve this problem efficiently, given the constraints where `N` and `X_i` can be as large as \(10^9\) and `M` up to \(10^6\) per test case, we need to avoid simulating each step of the snake's movement. Instead, we'll model the snake's path as a series of direction segments and manage a sliding window to keep track of the last `N` positions of the snake's head. 

**Key Findings:**

1. **Direction Segmentation:** The snake's movement can be divided into segments where it moves in a constant direction (north, east, south, west). Each move consists of a direction change followed by a certain number of steps in that direction.

2. **Sliding Window for Tracking:** To efficiently track the positions of the snake's head over the last `N` steps, we use a sliding window approach. This window will store segments of the snake's movement that fall within the last `N` steps.

3. **Min/Max Coordinates:** For each segment within the sliding window, we maintain the minimum and maximum `x` and `y` coordinates to calculate the area of the smallest axis-aligned rectangle that covers the snake.

4. **Efficient Update Mechanism:** As the snake moves, segments that fall outside the last `N` steps are removed from the sliding window, and new segments are added. We ensure that updating the min and max coordinates can be done efficiently without reprocessing the entire window.

5. **Area Calculation:** For each move, instead of checking every single step, we calculate potential candidate areas based on the current and previous segments. The minimum area encountered during the move is then selected as `f(i)`.

6. **Modulo Operation:** Since the result can be very large, we keep applying the modulo \(1{,}000{,}000{,}007\) operation to keep the numbers within manageable bounds.

By leveraging these insights, we can implement an efficient solution that handles large inputs within the given constraints.
