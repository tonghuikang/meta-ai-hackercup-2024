**Key Findings:**

1. **Snake Representation:**
   - The snake consists of `N` connected cells on a 2D plane. Each cell occupies a unique `(x, y)` coordinate.
   - Given the large constraints (`N` up to \(10^9\)), it's impractical to track each cell's position individually.

2. **Direction Management:**
   - The snake's head can face one of four directions: North, East, South, or West.
   - Each move consists of a turn (`L`, `R`, or `S`) followed by a slither of `X_i` units in the current direction.
   - Directions can be managed using directional vectors and maintaining the current orientation.

3. **Bounding Rectangle Calculation:**
   - To compute the minimal axis-aligned rectangle covering the snake, track the minimum and maximum `x` and `y` coordinates of the snake's head and tail.
   - Since the snake moves in a connected manner, the tail follows the head's previous positions with a delay of `N` units. This implies that the head's path affects the bounding rectangle over time.

4. **Efficient Tracking with Queues:**
   - Utilize queues to manage the head's movement history, which affects the tail's position due to the snake's length.
   - Maintain current bounding coordinates (`min_x`, `max_x`, `min_y`, `max_y`) and update them as the head moves. When the tail moves, update the bounds accordingly.

5. **Optimization:**
   - Given the large input sizes (`T` up to \(10^5\), `M` up to \(10^6\)), it's crucial to process each test case efficiently, preferably in linear time relative to `M`.
   - Use precomputed direction changes and avoid redundant calculations by updating the bounding rectangle incrementally.

6. **Modulo Operation:**
   - Since the final sum can be large, apply the modulo \(1{,}000{,}000{,}007\) at each addition to prevent integer overflow.

**Note:**

The problem presents substantial challenges due to the large constraints, especially handling the snake's length (`N` up to \(10^9\)) and the number of moves (`M` up to \(10^6\)). A na√Øve simulation approach would be computationally infeasible. The key to solving this problem efficiently lies in abstracting the snake's movements and calculating the bounding rectangle by tracking essential metrics (like cumulative direction changes and their impact on the bounding coordinates) without explicitly simulating each cell's position.

The provided code outlines an initial framework for approaching the problem, emphasizing direction management and bounding rectangle tracking. However, due to the problem's complexity, further optimizations and a more sophisticated algorithmic strategy are necessary to handle all edge cases and ensure performance within the stipulated constraints.
