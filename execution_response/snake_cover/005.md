The key to solving this problem efficiently lies in observing that the minimal area of the axis-aligned rectangle covering the snake changes only when the head of the snake moves beyond its current boundaries (minimum and maximum x and y coordinates). Since the snake can overlap itself and cells can occupy the same coordinates, the area can only increase or stay the same as the snake moves.

Here are the key findings:

1. **Bounding Rectangle Expansion**: The area of the rectangle covering the snake changes only when the snake's head moves beyond its current minimum or maximum x or y coordinates.
   
2. **Per Move Area Calculation**:
   - **Initial Area**: Before each move, calculate the current area based on `min_x`, `max_x`, `min_y`, and `max_y`.
   - **Move Execution**: Update the snake's head position according to the move direction and distance.
   - **Boundary Updates**: Check if the new head position updates `min_x`, `max_x`, `min_y`, or `max_y`.
   - **New Area**: Calculate the new area after the move execution and boundary updates.
   - **Minimal Area During Move**: Since the snake moves in a straight line during each move, the minimal area covering the snake during the move is either the initial area or the new area, whichever is smaller.

3. **Efficient Computation**:
   - **O(1) per Move**: By using the above approach, each move's minimal area can be calculated in O(1) time.
   - **O(M) per Test Case**: The total time per test case is O(M), which is acceptable under the given constraints.

Now, let's implement the solution in Python:

This code reads the input, processes each move by updating the direction and the head's position, checks if the current move causes the bounding rectangle to expand, and calculates the minimal area during the move accordingly. The cumulative sum of these minimal areas for all moves is computed modulo \(1,000,000,007\) as per the problem statement.
