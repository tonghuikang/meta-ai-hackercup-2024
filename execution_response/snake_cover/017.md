**Key Findings:**

To solve this problem efficiently, we need to model the snake's movement on an infinite 2D plane while calculating the minimal area of the axis-aligned rectangle that can contain the snake during each move. Given the constraints, especially with large values for \( N \) (up to \( 10^9 \)) and \( M \) (up to \( 10^6 \)), it's crucial to optimize the approach to avoid per-step simulations, which would be computationally infeasible.

Here's the breakdown of the approach:

1. **Direction Handling:**
   - The snake can face one of four directions: North, East, South, or West.
   - We map these directions to coordinate changes: North (\( (0, 1) \)), East (\( (1, 0) \)), South (\( (0, -1) \)), and West (\( (-1, 0) \)).

2. **Movement Simulation:**
   - We track the head's position and direction.
   - For each move, we update the head's direction based on the turn ('L', 'R', 'S') and then determine the new head positions as it moves forward.
   - Since \( N \) can be very large, we avoid tracking each cell individually. Instead, we consider the relative movement of the head and maintain the range of \( x \) and \( y \) coordinates covered by the snake.

3. **Tracking Minimum Area:**
   - For each move, we calculate how the snake's movement affects the bounding rectangle's dimensions (\( \text{min}_x \), \( \text{max}_x \), \( \text{min}_y \), \( \text{max}_y \)).
   - The area \( A(t) \) is given by \( (\text{max}_x - \text{min}_x) \times (\text{max}_y - \text{min}_y) \).
   - We determine the minimum area achieved during each move and accumulate these values.

4. **Optimization:**
   - Given the large constraints, we ensure that all operations within each test case are performed in linear time with respect to \( M \).
   - We use efficient data structures and mathematical calculations to keep track of the necessary parameters without explicit simulation.

By following this optimized approach, we can handle the problem within the given constraints effectively.
