### Key Findings:

1. **Snake Representation**:
   - The snake is represented as a sequence of positions on a 2D plane, with the head moving according to the given directions and the tail following the head's path.
   - Given the large possible size of the snake (`N` up to \(10^9\)), it's infeasible to track each cell's position explicitly.

2. **Movement and Direction**:
   - The snake's movement is determined by a series of turns (`L`, `R`, `S`) and steps (`X_i`).
   - The direction updates can be managed using direction vectors and tracking the current facing direction.

3. **Bounding Rectangle Calculation**:
   - The area of the smallest axis-aligned rectangle covering the snake depends on the extremal coordinates (min and max x and y) of the snake's cells.
   - As the snake moves, these extremal values can change based on the direction of movement and the current position of the head and tail.

4. **Sliding Window Approach**:
   - Since the snake's length is `N`, we can model its movement as a sliding window over time steps.
   - We track the extremal coordinates within this window to determine the rectangle's area.
   - Efficiently updating these extremal values as the window slides is crucial for performance.

5. **Minimizing the Rectangle Area**:
   - For each move, we need to find the minimum area of the bounding rectangle during the move's time interval.
   - This involves simulating the movement and keeping track of the minimal area encountered.

6. **Efficient Computation**:
   - Given the constraints (`M` up to \(10^6\) and `X_i` up to \(10^9\)), it's essential to avoid per-unit simulations.
   - Instead, identify patterns or mathematical relationships that allow computing the required values in constant or logarithmic time per move.

7. **Modular Arithmetic**:
   - Since the final result needs to be modulo \(10^9 + 7\), ensure that all intermediate computations also handle large numbers appropriately to prevent overflow.
