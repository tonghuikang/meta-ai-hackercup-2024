**Key Findings:**

1. **Snake Representation:** 
   - The snake can be represented by tracking its head position, direction, and the positions of its segments implicitly based on movement history.
   
2. **Direction Handling:** 
   - Use direction vectors for North, East, South, and West to update the snake's heading based on turns (`L`, `R`, `S`).

3. **Position Tracking:** 
   - Maintain the current head position and update it based on the direction and movement steps.
   - Since the snake has a length of \( N \), the tail moves forward as the head moves, effectively maintaining a window of the last \( N \) positions.
   
4. **Rectangle Area Calculation:** 
   - Track the minimum and maximum \( x \) and \( y \) coordinates of the snake's segments to compute the area of the smallest axis-aligned rectangle covering the snake.
   - To efficiently compute the minimum area \( A(t) \) during each move without simulating every second, analyze how the rectangle's dimensions change with each step and determine the point where the area is minimized.
   
5. **Optimizing for Large Inputs:** 
   - Given the constraints (\( N \) and \( X_i \) up to \( 10^9 \)), it's essential to avoid per-unit simulation.
   - Instead, calculate the potential changes in the bounding rectangle analytically based on the direction and movement length.

6. **Modular Arithmetic:** 
   - Since the final answer requires the sum modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \), ensure all additions are performed under this modulus to prevent overflow.
