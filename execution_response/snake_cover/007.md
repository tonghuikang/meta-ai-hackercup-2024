**Key Findings:**

1. **Snake Representation:**
   - The snake consists of `N` connected cells on an infinite 2D grid.
   - Initially, the snake is horizontal, with the head (`cell 1`) at `(0, 0)` facing east, and the rest of the body extending to the west.

2. **Movement Mechanics:**
   - Each move consists of a turn (`L`, `R`, or `S`) and a slither of `X_i` units in the current direction.
   - After each unit of movement:
     - The head moves one unit forward.
     - Each subsequent cell moves to the previous cell's position.

3. **Tracking Positions:**
   - Due to the large constraints (`N` and `X_i` up to \(10^9\)), it's infeasible to track each cell individually.
   - Instead, track key parameters:
     - **Head Position:** Current coordinates `(x, y)`.
     - **Direction:** Current facing direction (`North`, `East`, `South`, `West`).
     - **Tail Position:** Calculated based on the head's position minus `N` steps in the path taken.

4. **Bounding Rectangle Calculation:**
   - The minimal axis-aligned rectangle enclosing the snake is determined by:
     - The minimum and maximum `x` and `y` coordinates of all cells.
   - Since the snake can overlap itself, the rectangle depends on the furthest extents reached during the movement.

5. **Efficient Computation of `f(i)`:**
   - For each move, determine the range of positions the head traverses.
   - Calculate the corresponding positions of the tail.
   - Track the minimum and maximum `x` and `y` over this interval to determine the rectangle's area.
   - The minimal area `f(i)` is the smallest such area during the slither of move `i`.

6. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - Since the sum of `f(i)` can be large, compute the final result modulo \(1{,}000{,}000{,}007\).
