**Key Findings:**

1. **Coupon Collector Variation:** This problem is a variation of the classic coupon collector problem. Instead of collecting coupons with a fixed probability, the probability of obtaining a new coupon depends on the number of dollar bills \( D \) spent and the parameter \( P \).

2. **Probability Mechanics:** When inserting \( D \) dollar bills:
   - There's a \(\min((D - 1) \times P, 100)\%\) chance to get a *new* denomination.
   - There's a \(100 - \min((D - 1) \times P, 100)\%\) chance to get a *random* denomination, which could be a duplicate.

3. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - **For \( P = 0 \):** The probability of getting a new denomination doesn't improve with spending more bills. Hence, the optimal strategy is to insert 1 dollar bill each time.
   - **For \( P = 100 \):** The probability of getting a new denomination increases linearly with \( D \) up to a certain point where it reaches 100%. It's optimal to choose \( D \) such that the probability of getting a new denomination is maximized without overspending.
   - **For \( 0 < P < 100 \):** There's a trade-off between the number of bills spent and the probability of obtaining a new denomination. The optimal \( D \) needs to be chosen based on the current number of collected coins to balance cost and success probability.

4. **Mathematical Approach:**
   - Given the large constraint on \( N \) (\( N \leq 10^{15} \)), a simulation-based approach is infeasible.
   - Utilize mathematical expressions derived from the probability mechanics to calculate the expected number of dollar bills required.
   - Leverage harmonic series-like summations to account for the diminishing probability of obtaining new denominations as more coins are collected.

5. **Efficiency Considerations:**
   - Precompute and reuse calculations where possible.
   - Optimize the computation of expected values to handle large \( N \) efficiently without iterating through each denomination.

With these insights, the following Python code implements an efficient solution to compute the expected number of dollar bills required to collect all \( N \) coin denominations optimally.
