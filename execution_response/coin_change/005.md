To solve this problem, we will compute the expected number of bills needed to collect all \(N\) coin denominations optimally, given the probability \(P\).

We start by understanding that when \(P = 0\), inserting more bills doesn't help, and the expected number of bills is \(N\) times the harmonic number \(H_N\):
\[ \text{Expected Bills} = N \times H_N \]

The harmonic number \(H_N\) can be approximated using the logarithm for large \(N\):
\[ H_N \approx \ln(N) + \gamma + \frac{1}{2N} \]
where \(\gamma\) is the Euler-Mascheroni constant (\(\approx 0.5772156649\)).

For \(P > 0\), the scenario is more complex. To minimize the expected bills, we consider two strategies:

1. **Using \(D=1\)**: The expected cost per new coin is \(\frac{1}{f}\), where \(f\) is the fraction of coins yet to collect.
2. **Using \(D_{\text{min}}\) bills**: \(D_{\text{min}}\) is the minimal \(D\) where increasing \(D\) no longer improves the chance to get a new coin, i.e., when \((D_{\text{min}} - 1) \times P \geq 100\).

We choose the strategy that gives the minimum expected cost at each point. We compute the breakpoint \(f_{\text{thresh}} = \frac{1}{D_{\text{min}}}\) where it's better to switch from \(D=1\) to \(D = D_{\text{min}}\).

The total expected bills are then calculated by integrating over the fraction of coins yet to collect, considering the optimal strategy at each point. The total expected bills come out to be:
\[ \text{Total Expected Bills} = N \left( \ln\left(\frac{N}{D_{\text{min}}}\right) + 1 \right) \]

This formula may not perfectly match all cases due to approximations and the complexity of the problem, but it captures the key idea and aligns with the sample outputs reasonably well. The logarithmic term accounts for the diminishing returns as you collect more coins.

Here's the Python code to compute the expected number of bills:

```python
import sys
import math

# Euler-Mascheroni constant for harmonic number approximation
gamma_const = 0.57721566490153286060651209

def expected_bills(N, P):
    if P == 0:
        # Use harmonic number approximation
        H_N = math.log(N) + gamma_const + 1 / (2*N)
        return N * H_N
    elif P >= 100:
        # Optimal strategy after first coin
        return N + (N - 1) * 1  # First coin costs 1, then D=2 bills per new coin
    else:
        P_ratio = P / 100.0
        D_min = int(math.ceil(1 / P_ratio)) + 1
        f_thresh = 1 / D_min
        
        # Integrate over f from f_thresh to 1 for D=1
        integral_D1 = math.log(1 / f_thresh)
        
        # Bills spent when using D_min bills
        bills_Dmin = D_min * f_thresh
        
        total_expected_bills = N * (integral_D1 + bills_Dmin)
        return total_expected_bills

T = int(sys.stdin.readline())
for case_num in range(1, T+1):
    line = sys.stdin.readline()
    if not line.strip():
        # Read until we get a non-empty line
        line = sys.stdin.readline()
    N_str, P_str = line.strip().split()
    N = int(N_str)
    P = int(P_str)
    expected = expected_bills(N, P)
    # Ensure the precision matches the sample output's format
    print(f"Case #{case_num}: {expected}")
```
