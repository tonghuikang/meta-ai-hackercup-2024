**Key Findings:**

1. **Computational Complexity:** 
   - Direct enumeration of all lattice points within each triangle and the circle is infeasible due to the high constraints (up to \(10^6\) triangles and radius \(R \leq 10^6\)).
   
2. **Efficient Counting with Scanline Approach:** 
   - Utilize a scanline algorithm for each triangle. For each integer y-coordinate within the triangle's vertical span and the circle's bounds, determine the range of x-coordinates that lie inside both the triangle and the circle.
   
3. **Precomputation of Circle Boundaries:** 
   - Precompute the horizontal x-limits of the circle for each y-coordinate to quickly intersect with the triangle's x-range during the scanline process.

4. **Handling Fully Inside Triangles:**
   - Triangles entirely within the circle can leverage Pick's Theorem to count lattice points efficiently by calculating the area and boundary points.

5. **Optimizing Edge Intersections:**
   - For each triangle, process its edges to find intersection points with horizontal lines (scanlines) efficiently, minimizing redundant calculations.

6. **Modulo Operation for Large Sums:**
   - Since the total heat can be very large, perform modulo \(1{,}000{,}000{,}007\) operations incrementally to prevent integer overflow and ensure accuracy.

7. **Language Considerations:**
   - Given Python's slower execution for large-scale computations, optimizations such as using integer arithmetic wherever possible and minimizing redundant calculations are crucial. However, for very large inputs, a faster language like C++ might be more suitable.

Below is the Python implementation based on the scanline approach optimized for the problem constraints:
