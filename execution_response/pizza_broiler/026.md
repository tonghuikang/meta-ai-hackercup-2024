**Key Findings:**

1. **Lattice Point Counting**:
   - The primary challenge is to efficiently count the number of lattice points within both a given triangle and a circle.
   - Directly iterating over all possible points within the circle for each triangle is computationally infeasible due to the high constraints (e.g., \( R \leq 10^6 \) and \( N \leq 10^6 \)).

2. **Efficient Point Inclusion Testing**:
   - Utilize mathematical formulas to determine whether a given lattice point lies inside a triangle. This can be done using barycentric coordinates or the area-based method.
   - To check if a point lies within the circle, verify if \( x^2 + y^2 \leq R^2 \).

3. **Preprocessing and Optimization**:
   - Precompute all lattice points within the circle once for each test case, storing them in an efficient data structure (e.g., a list).
   - For each triangle, iterate only through the precomputed lattice points that fall within its bounding box to reduce the number of inclusion tests.
   - Utilize spatial partitioning or grid-based methods to quickly retrieve candidate points for each triangle.

4. **Handling Multiple Test Cases and Large Input Sizes**:
   - Read the input in a buffered manner to handle large inputs efficiently.
   - Implement modular arithmetic carefully to prevent integer overflow and ensure results are computed modulo \( 10^9+7 \).

5. **Mathematical Precision and Edge Cases**:
   - Ensure that boundary points (points lying exactly on the edges of the triangle or circle) are included as per the problem statement.
   - Handle degenerate triangles and other special geometric configurations gracefully.

6. **Parallelization and Bit Manipulation (Advanced)**:
   - For further optimization, consider parallel processing or bit manipulation techniques to handle multiple points simultaneously, leveraging Python's capabilities.

Given the complexity and constraints, the problem likely requires a highly optimized algorithm possibly leveraging number theory or geometric insights beyond brute-force methods.
