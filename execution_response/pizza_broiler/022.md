**Key Findings:**

1. **Problem Breakdown:**
   - **Objective:** For each triangle slice, count the number of lattice points that lie within both the triangle and a circle of radius \( R \) centered at the origin.
   - **Types of Triangles:**
     - **Fully Inside:** All three vertices are inside or on the circle.
     - **Partially Intersecting:** At least one vertex is strictly inside the circle, and the intersection with the circle results in a single connected region outside.

2. **Approach:**
   - **Fully Inside Triangles:**
     - Utilize **Pick's Theorem** to compute the number of lattice points within the triangle efficiently.
     - **Pick's Theorem:** For a simple polygon with integer vertices, the number of interior lattice points \( I \) and boundary lattice points \( B \) are related to the area \( A \) by \( A = I + \frac{B}{2} - 1 \). Thus, the total lattice points are \( I + B = A + \frac{B}{2} + 1 \).
   - **Partially Intersecting Triangles:**
     - Implement a **scanline algorithm**:
       - For each integer \( y \) within the overlap of the triangle's y-range and the circle's y-range, determine the intersection segment of the triangle at that \( y \).
       - Compute the corresponding \( x \)-range within the circle for that \( y \).
       - Count the integer \( x \)-values that lie within both ranges.
     - **Optimization:** Since Python has performance limitations for high iteration counts, the scanline approach must be highly optimized, possibly leveraging efficient mathematical computations and minimal use of floating-point operations.

3. **Implementation Considerations:**
   - **Performance:** With constraints like \( N \leq 10^5 \) per test case and \( R \leq 10^6 \), the solution must minimize per-triangle and per-scanline computations.
   - **Edge Cases:** Handle triangles that lie exactly on the circle boundary and ensure that lattice points on edges are counted appropriately.
   - **Modularity:** Since the output requires results modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \), ensure that intermediate sums do not cause integer overflow by applying the modulo operation incrementally.

4. **Final Strategy:**
   - **Preprocessing:** For each triangle, first determine if it is fully inside the circle by checking all vertices.
   - **Counting:**
     - **If Fully Inside:** Apply Pick's Theorem directly.
     - **If Partially Intersecting:** Use the scanline approach to count lattice points within both the triangle and the circle.
   - **Summation:** Aggregate the counts for each triangle and apply the modulo operation as required.
