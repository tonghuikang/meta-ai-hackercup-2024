When approaching this problem, several key observations and strategies are essential:

**Key Findings:**

1. **Triangle Classification:** 
   - **Fully Inside the Circle:** If all three vertices of a triangle are within or on the boundary of the circle, we can efficiently calculate the number of lattice points inside it using **Pick's Theorem**.
   - **Partially Inside the Circle:** If a triangle partially intersects the circle, determining the exact number of lattice points within the intersection is more complex. However, given the problem constraints and the requirement for an efficient solution, we consider iterating through the bounding box of the triangle and checking each lattice point's inclusion in both the triangle and the circle.

2. **Pick's Theorem Application:**
   - **Area Calculation:** The area of the triangle can be computed using the **shoelace formula**.
   - **Boundary Points:** The number of lattice points on the boundary of the triangle can be determined using the **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)** of the differences in coordinates between vertices.
   - **Interior Points:** Using Pick's Theorem, the number of interior lattice points is calculated as \( i = A - \frac{b}{2} + 1 \), where \( A \) is the area and \( b \) is the number of boundary points.

3. **Efficiency Considerations:**
   - Given the large possible values for \( N \) and \( R \), the solution must be optimized for speed. This includes minimizing redundant calculations and leveraging efficient mathematical operations.
   - For partially intersecting triangles, iterating through each potential lattice point can be computationally intensive. Hence, optimizations such as limiting the search to the triangle's bounding box and early termination when points are outside the circle can help.

4. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - All counts should be computed modulo \( 1{,}000{,}000{,}007 \) to handle large sums efficiently.

The following Python code implements these strategies, ensuring efficient computation within the given constraints:

**Explanation of the Code:**

1. **Utility Functions:**
   - `is_inside_circle(x, y, R_sq)`: Checks if a point \((x, y)\) is inside or on the boundary of the circle.
   - `area2(...)`: Computes twice the area of the triangle using the shoelace formula.
   - `boundary_points(...)`: Calculates the number of lattice points on a line segment between two points using the GCD of coordinate differences.
   - `count_lattice_points_full(...)`: Applies Pick's Theorem to count interior lattice points for triangles entirely within the circle.
   - `point_in_triangle(...)`: Determines if a given point lies within a triangle using barycentric coordinates.
   - `count_lattice_points_partial(...)`: Iterates through the bounding box of a partially intersecting triangle, checking each relevant lattice point for inclusion in both the triangle and the circle.

2. **Main Logic:**
   - Reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - Reads the number of triangles \( N \) and the circle's radius \( R \).
     - For each triangle:
       - Determines if it is fully inside the circle.
       - If fully inside, uses Pick's Theorem to count lattice points.
       - If partially inside, iterates through the bounding box to count relevant lattice points.
     - Accumulates the count modulo \(1{,}000{,}000{,}007\).
   - Outputs the result for each test case in the specified format.

**Note:** Due to the computational intensity of handling partially intersecting triangles, especially with large \( N \) and \( R \), the solution may face performance challenges in Python. Optimizations or implementing time-critical sections in a compiled language like C++ could enhance efficiency.
