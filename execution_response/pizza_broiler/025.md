**Key Findings:**

1. **Triangle Classification:**
   - **Fully Inside:** If all three vertices of a triangle satisfy \(x^2 + y^2 \leq R^2\), the entire triangle lies within the circle. For these triangles, the number of lattice points can be efficiently computed using **Pick's Theorem**.
   - **Partially Overlapping:** Triangles that are not fully inside the circle intersect with it. For these, counting the exact number of lattice points within both the triangle and the circle is more complex and requires specialized geometric algorithms.

2. **Pick's Theorem:**
   - For triangles fully inside the circle, **Pick's Theorem** provides a direct way to calculate the number of integer lattice points within and on the boundary of the triangle.
     \[
     \text{Area} = I + \frac{B}{2} - 1 \implies I + B = \text{Area} + \frac{B}{2} + 1
     \]
     where \(I\) is the number of interior lattice points and \(B\) is the number of boundary lattice points.

3. **Counting Boundary Lattice Points:**
   - The number of lattice points on the boundary of a triangle can be determined using the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the differences in the x and y coordinates of its edges.
     \[
     B = \text{gcd}(dx, dy) \text{ for each edge}
     \]
  
4. **Handling Partially Overlapping Triangles:**
   - For triangles intersecting the circle, an efficient algorithm is required to count the lattice points within the intersection. Given the problem constraints (up to \(10^6\) triangles and \(R\) up to \(10^6\)), a per-triangle approach is computationally intensive.
   - One potential approach is to iterate over each partially overlapping triangle and apply geometric algorithms (like scanline) to determine the exact count of lattice points within the intersection. However, this needs to be optimized to handle the large input size efficiently.

5. **Modularity:**
   - Since the final count can be very large, all calculations should be performed modulo \(1{,}000{,}000{,}007\).

6. **Optimizations:**
   - Preprocessing steps such as precomputing GCD values or leveraging symmetry might be necessary to optimize the counting process.
   - Efficient handling of input/output operations to manage large datasets within the time constraints.

Given the complexity of handling partially overlapping triangles, the provided Python code focuses primarily on counting lattice points for triangles fully within the circle using Pick's Theorem. Handling partially overlapping triangles would require additional geometric processing, which is beyond the scope of this implementation.
