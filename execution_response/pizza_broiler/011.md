**Key Findings:**

To solve the problem of counting the number of lattice points inside both a given triangle and a circle efficiently for multiple slices, we can consider the following approach:

1. **Scanline Algorithm:**
   - For each triangle, determine the range of y-coordinates (`y_min` to `y_max`) that the triangle spans.
   - For each integer y-coordinate within this range:
     - Find the intersection points (`x` values) of the triangle's edges with the horizontal line at that y-coordinate. This will give us the range of x-values (`x_left` to `x_right`) where the lattice points are inside the triangle for that specific y.
     - Simultaneously, determine the range of x-values (`x_circle_left` to `x_circle_right`) where the lattice points are inside the circle for the same y-coordinate.
     - The overlap of these two x-ranges gives the range of x-values where the lattice points are inside both the triangle and the circle.
     - Count the number of integer x-values within this overlapping range and accumulate the count.

2. **Efficient Edge Intersection Calculation:**
   - Precompute the slopes of the triangle edges to efficiently find the intersection points with horizontal lines.
   - Handle edge cases where the horizontal line may intersect a vertex or lie along an edge to avoid double-counting.

3. **Optimizations:**
   - Since the problem involves processing up to \(10^6\) triangles, the implementation needs to be highly optimized.
   - Utilize integer arithmetic to avoid floating-point inaccuracies and improve performance.
   - Precompute reusable values where possible.

4. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - Since the final result needs to be presented modulo \(10^9 + 7\), ensure that the accumulation of counts is performed using modular arithmetic to prevent integer overflow.

5. **Handling Multiple Test Cases:**
   - Process each test case independently, adhering to the input constraints and efficiently resetting any necessary data structures between test cases.

By implementing the above strategy, we can efficiently compute the required count of lattice points for each triangle across all test cases within the given constraints.
