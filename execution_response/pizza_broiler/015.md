**Key Findings:**

1. **Problem Breakdown:**
   - For each triangle, we need to determine the number of lattice points that lie within both the triangle and the given circle of radius \( R \).
   - Directly iterating over all possible lattice points within the circle for each triangle is computationally infeasible due to the large constraints (\( R \) up to \( 10^6 \) and \( N \) up to \( 10^6 \)).

2. **Efficient Lattice Point Counting:**
   - Utilize **Pick's Theorem** for counting lattice points inside a polygon, which states that for a simple polygon with integer vertices:
     \[
     \text{Area} = I + \frac{B}{2} - 1
     \]
     where \( I \) is the number of interior lattice points and \( B \) is the number of boundary lattice points.
   - However, Pick's Theorem alone does not account for the intersection with the circle. An extension or combination with geometric algorithms is necessary.

3. **Segment Intersection with Circle:**
   - For each edge of the triangle, compute its intersection with the circle to identify the segments of the triangle that lie within the circle.
   - Use **scanline algorithms** to iterate over the y-coordinates within the intersection bounds and determine valid x-coordinate ranges for lattice points.

4. **Optimizations:**
   - Precompute the range of y-coordinates that lie within the circle to limit the scanning process.
   - Utilize symmetry and mathematical properties to reduce redundant calculations.
   - Implement efficient integer arithmetic to handle large coordinates and prevent overflow.

5. **Handling Multiple Test Cases:**
   - Since the sum of \( N \) across all test cases is up to \( 10^6 \), ensure that the algorithm processes each triangle independently and efficiently without excessive memory usage.
