**Key Findings:**

To solve the problem of counting lattice points within the intersection of triangles and a circle, the following approach is adopted:

1. **Determining Triangle Position:**
   - **Fully Inside:** If all three vertices of a triangle lie within or on the boundary of the circle, the entire triangle is considered fully inside. For such triangles, the number of lattice points can be efficiently calculated using **Pick's Theorem**, which states:
     \[
     \text{Number of Lattice Points} = A - \frac{B}{2} + 1
     \]
     where \( A \) is the area of the triangle, and \( B \) is the number of lattice points on its boundary.
     
   - **Partially Overlapping:** If at least one vertex of the triangle lies inside the circle and the triangle is not fully contained, the triangle partially overlaps with the circle. For these triangles, an efficient **scanline algorithm** is employed:
     - **Scanline Approach:** Iterate over each integer \( x \) within the bounding box of the triangle.
     - For each \( x \), determine the range of \( y \)-values that lie within both the triangle and the circle.
     - Count the integer \( y \)-values within this overlapping range.

2. **Efficiency Considerations:**
   - Given the constraints (up to \( 10^6 \) triangles and \( R \) up to \( 10^6 \)), it's crucial to implement the scanline approach efficiently to ensure that the solution runs within acceptable time limits.
   - The number of partially overlapping triangles is assumed to be manageable based on the problem's constraints, allowing the scanline method to be feasible in Python.

3. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - Since the final result can be large, all counts are computed modulo \( 1{,}000{,}000{,}007 \).

4. **Handling Multiple Test Cases:**
   - Each test case is processed independently, accumulating the total heat received across all slices.

The following Python code implements the above strategy.
