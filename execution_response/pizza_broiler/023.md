**Key Findings:**

1. **Problem Break Down**:
   - We need to calculate the number of lattice points that lie within both a given triangle (pizza slice) and a circle of radius \( R \) centered at the origin.
   - The task must be repeated for multiple triangles across several test cases, with constraints allowing up to \( 1,000,000 \) triangles in total.

2. **Challenges**:
   - **Efficiency**: Naively iterating over all possible lattice points within each triangle and checking their presence inside the circle is computationally infeasible due to the large input size (\( R \) and coordinates up to \( 1,000,000 \)).
   - **Geometric Computations**: Accurately determining whether a point lies within both a triangle and a circle requires precise geometric calculations, which can be time-consuming.

3. **Optimized Approach**:
   - **Bounding Box Reduction**: For each triangle, compute the axis-aligned bounding box to limit the range of lattice points that need to be checked.
   - **Inclusion Checks**:
     - **Point in Circle**: Use the equation \( x^2 + y^2 \leq R^2 \) to quickly determine if a point lies within the circle.
     - **Point in Triangle**: Utilize barycentric coordinates or the area method to efficiently check if a point is inside the triangle.
   - **Preprocessing**: Since the circle is centered at the origin and has a fixed radius \( R \) for each test case, precompute the range of \( x \) values for each \( y \) that lie inside the circle to speed up the point-in-circle checks.

4. **Implementation Considerations**:
   - **Language Choice**: Python may struggle with the required performance for the given constraints. Critical sections, especially nested loops for point iteration, should be optimized or replaced with vectorized operations using libraries like NumPy.
   - **Modular Arithmetic**: Since the final result must be presented modulo \( 1,000,000,007 \), ensure that intermediate sums are also handled modulo this value to prevent integer overflow.
   - **Edge Cases**: Handle triangles that are entirely inside the circle separately from those that partially intersect to optimize checks and avoid redundant computations.

5. **Potential Optimizations**:
   - **Vectorization**: Utilize NumPy's vectorized operations to handle bulk computations of points within bounding boxes.
   - **Early Termination**: If a triangle is entirely within the circle, use Pick's Theorem to calculate the number of lattice points without iterating over each point.
   - **Caching**: Precompute and cache repetitive calculations, such as distance checks for points within certain ranges of \( y \).

6. **Final Strategy**:
   - For each test case:
     - For each triangle:
       - Determine if it's fully inside the circle.
         - If yes, compute the number of lattice points using an efficient method (e.g., Pick's Theorem).
       - If partially inside:
         - Compute the intersection region and count the lattice points within this region.
     - Sum the counts for all triangles, applying modulo \( 1,000,000,007 \).

Given the complexity and performance constraints, the following Python implementation focuses on optimized computations using NumPy. However, due to Python's inherent performance limitations for such large-scale computations, this solution may still face performance challenges for the upper limits of the input size.

**Notes**:
- This implementation uses a combination of Pick's Theorem for triangles entirely within the circle and a scanline approach for partially overlapping triangles.
- The `count_lattice_points_in_triangle_and_circle` function iterates over the relevant range of \( y \)-coordinates and computes the corresponding \( x \)-ranges that lie within both the triangle and the circle.
- Due to Python's performance limitations, especially with nested loops and large input sizes, this solution may not be efficient enough for the upper-bound constraints. For better performance, implementing critical sections in a compiled language like C++ or using optimized libraries would be advisable.
