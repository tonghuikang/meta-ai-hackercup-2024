Here are the key findings when solving this problem:

1. **Constraints Analysis**: Given the constraints (coordinates up to ±1e6, N up to 1e6), we need an algorithm that processes each triangle efficiently. We cannot iterate over all lattice points within the triangle's bounding box if the triangle can be large.

2. **Per-Triangle Scanline Approach**: Since the triangle is convex and has edges, we can process the triangle per scanline (either x or y). For each integer value of x, we compute the intersection of the triangle with the vertical line x = constant. This gives us intervals of y values for which (x, y) is inside the triangle.

3. **Efficient Edge Handling**: To compute these intervals per x, we need to handle edges efficiently. For each edge, we determine if it contributes at the current x and calculate the corresponding y using linear interpolation. Special attention is needed for vertical edges (where x0 == x1).

4. **Including Circle Constraint**: For each (x, y) that lies inside the triangle, we need to check if it also lies inside the circle (x^2 + y^2 ≤ R^2). By combining the triangle edge detection with the circle boundary check, we can count the exact number of lattice points that satisfy both constraints.

5. **Optimizing Time Complexity**: By using the scanline method, we reduce the per-triangle processing time to be proportional to the x-range of the triangle (from min_x to max_x). Since the triangles are expected to be of moderate size, and we process O(1) y values per x, the total time remains acceptable.

6. **Edge Cases Handling**: Careful handling is necessary for cases where the triangle edges are vertical, where edges overlap exactly at integer x-values, or where multiple edges contribute at the same x. Ensuring correct inclusivity of points on the edges and vertices is also important.

Now, here's the Python code implementing the approach:

        R_squared = R * R
        triangles = []
        for _ in range(N):
            xA, yA, xB, yB, xC, yC = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
