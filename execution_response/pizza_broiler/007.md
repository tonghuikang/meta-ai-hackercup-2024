**Key Findings:**

To solve this problem efficiently, consider the following approach:

1. **Triangle Classification:**
   - **Fully Inside the Circle:** 
     - For triangles where all three vertices satisfy \(x^2 + y^2 \leq R^2\), the entire triangle lies within the circle. 
     - Use **Pick's Theorem** to calculate the number of lattice points inside such triangles. Pick's Theorem states that for a polygon with integer vertices:
       \[
       \text{Area} = I + \frac{B}{2} - 1
       \]
       where \(I\) is the number of interior lattice points and \(B\) is the number of boundary lattice points. Rearranging gives:
       \[
       I = \text{Area} - \frac{B}{2} + 1
       \]
       Since the segments of the triangle have integer endpoints, \(B\) can be calculated using the **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)** for each edge.

   - **Partially Intersecting the Circle:**
     - For triangles that are partially inside the circle, calculate the number of lattice points within the intersection of the triangle and the circle.
     - Given the problem constraints (triangles have connected regions outside the circle and at least one vertex inside), iterating over the bounding box of the triangle and counting lattice points that satisfy both the triangle and circle conditions can be optimized.
     - Implement a **scanline** approach or **Bounding Box Iteration** with optimizations to handle large inputs efficiently.

2. **Optimizations:**
   - **Precompute GCDs:** Since edge calculations require GCD, precomputing or using an efficient GCD algorithm can speed up boundary calculations.
   - **Bounding Box Reduction:** Limit the iteration for partially intersecting triangles to their minimal bounding rectangles to reduce computation.
   - **Memoization:** Store intermediate results where possible, especially for repeated calculations across triangles.
   - **Modular Arithmetic:** Since the final answer requires modulo \(1{,}000{,}000{,}007\), ensure that all additions are performed under this modulus to prevent overflow.

3. **Handling Large Inputs:**
   - Given the constraints (\(T \leq 100\), \(N \leq 10^5\), and sum of \(N\) across test cases \(\leq 10^6\)), ensure that the per-triangle computation is optimized to run in near-constant time.
   - Avoid unnecessary computations by quickly classifying triangles and applying the most efficient counting method based on their classification.
