To solve this problem efficiently, especially given the large constraints, we need a strategic approach that minimizes computational overhead. Here's a summary of the key findings and the approach taken:

### **Key Findings and Approach:**

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to count the number of lattice points (points with integer coordinates) that lie within both a given triangle and a circle of radius \( R \) centered at the origin.
   - Each triangle is either completely inside the circle or partially intersecting it with specific constraints.

2. **Efficient Counting of Lattice Points:**
   - **Triangulation:** For triangles fully inside the circle, we can use **Pick's Theorem** to compute the number of lattice points inside the triangle efficiently. Pick's Theorem relates the area of a lattice polygon to the number of interior and boundary lattice points.
   - **Partial Intersection:** For triangles partially intersecting the circle, we need to compute the exact intersection area. This involves:
     - Determining the intersection polygon between the triangle and the circle.
     - Counting the lattice points within this intersected polygon, which can be complex due to the curved boundary introduced by the circle.

3. **Optimizing for Large Inputs:**
   - Given the large values of \( N \) and \( R \), iterating over every possible lattice point is computationally infeasible.
   - **Scanline Algorithm:** Utilize a scanline approach where we iterate over relevant \( x \)-coordinates and compute corresponding \( y \)-ranges that lie within both the triangle and the circle. This reduces the problem to manageable computations per triangle.
   - **Precomputing Circle Boundaries:** Precompute the valid \( y \)-ranges for each \( x \) within the circle to speed up intersection calculations with triangles.

4. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - Ensure that lattice points on the borders are correctly counted as inside the circle or triangle as per the problem statement.
   - Efficiently handle triangles that are tangent to the circle or have vertices lying exactly on the circle boundary.

5. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - Since the final count can be large, it's essential to compute the result modulo \( 1,000,000,007 \) to avoid integer overflow issues.

6. **Implementation Considerations:**
   - **Data Structures:** Use efficient data structures to store triangle vertices and precomputed circle boundaries.
   - **Mathematical Precision:** Ensure precise calculations when dealing with geometric intersections to avoid floating-point inaccuracies.
   - **Parallel Processing:** Although not implemented here, parallelizing computations per test case can further enhance performance for very large inputs.

### **Explanation of the Code:**

1. **Helper Functions:**
   - `is_point_in_circle`: Checks if a given point lies inside or on the circle.
   - `area_sign`: Computes the signed area of a triangle, useful for determining the orientation.
   - `point_in_triangle`: Determines if a point lies inside a given triangle using the barycentric technique.
   - `pick_theorem`: Implements **Pick's Theorem** to compute the number of interior lattice points within a triangle.

2. **Counting Lattice Points:**
   - For triangles completely inside the circle, we directly apply Pick's Theorem to determine the number of interior lattice points.
   - For partially intersecting triangles:
     - We iterate over a range of \( x \)-coordinates that lie within both the triangle and the circle.
     - For each \( x \), we determine the corresponding \( y \)-ranges that are inside the triangle.
     - We then intersect these \( y \)-ranges with those of the circle to find valid lattice points.
     - The count is accumulated for each triangle.

3. **Main Function:**
   - Reads the input and processes each test case.
   - For each triangle, determines whether it's fully inside the circle or partially intersecting.
   - Computes the count of lattice points accordingly and accumulates the total.
   - Outputs the result modulo \( 1,000,000,007 \) as required.

### **Note:**

- **Efficiency Considerations:** The provided implementation uses a straightforward approach for counting lattice points, which may not be optimal for the largest input sizes specified in the problem. For handling very large inputs efficiently, more advanced computational geometry techniques or optimized libraries may be necessary.
- **Handling Edge Cases:** Ensure that all edge cases, such as triangles lying exactly on the circle boundary or having overlapping vertices, are handled correctly.
