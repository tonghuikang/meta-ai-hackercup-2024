**Key Findings:**

1. **Problem Breakdown**: We need to calculate the total number of lattice points that lie inside or on both a given triangle and a circle centered at the origin with radius \( R \).

2. **Triangle Classification**:
   - **Fully Inside**: Triangles where all three vertices satisfy \( x^2 + y^2 \leq R^2 \). For these, we can directly compute the number of lattice points using Pick's Theorem.
   - **Partially Overlapping**: Triangles where at least one vertex is inside the circle, and the part of the triangle outside the circle is a single connected region. For these, we need to calculate the number of lattice points in the intersection of the triangle and the circle.

3. **Pick's Theorem**: For a triangle with integer coordinates:
   - **Area Calculation**: Using the Shoelace formula to compute twice the area (\( 2A \)).
   - **Boundary Points \( B \)**: Calculated using the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the differences in coordinates for each edge.
   - **Interior Points \( I \)**: Derived from Pick's Theorem \( A = I + \frac{B}{2} - 1 \).
   - **Total Lattice Points**: \( I + B = A + 1 + \frac{B}{2} \).

4. **Efficient Calculation for Fully Inside Triangles**:
   - Directly apply Pick's Theorem to compute the number of lattice points.

5. **Handling Partially Overlapping Triangles**:
   - Implement a method to count lattice points within the intersection of the triangle and the circle.
   - Due to high constraints, this requires an optimized approach, potentially involving bounding boxes and efficient point-in-triangle checks.

6. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Given the large input sizes (\( N \) up to \( 10^6 \) and \( R \) up to \( 10^6 \)), the solution must be highly optimized.
   - Avoid enumerating all lattice points within the circle, as this is computationally infeasible.

7. **Edge Cases**:
   - Ensure that triangles on the boundary of the circle are handled correctly, especially when vertices lie exactly on the circle.
   - Handle cases where the intersection region's boundary coincides with lattice points.

Below is the Python code that implements the above approach:

    shoelace = abs(x1*y2 + x2*y3 + x3*y1 - x1*y3 - x2*y1 - x3*y2)
    # Boundary points
    B = gcd(abs(x2 - x1), abs(y2 - y1)) + gcd(abs(x3 - x2), abs(y3 - y2)) + gcd(abs(x1 - x3), abs(y1 - y3))
    A = shoelace / 2
    # From Pick's theorem: I = A - B/2 + 1
