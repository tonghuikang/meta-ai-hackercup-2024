**Key Findings:**

To efficiently solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of lattice points within the intersection of each triangle slice and the circle of radius \( R \). Here's how to approach it:

1. **Classification of Triangles:**
   - **Fully Inside the Circle:** If all three vertices of a triangle lie inside or on the circle, the entire triangle is within the circle. For such triangles, we can employ **Pick's Theorem** to determine the number of lattice points inside the triangle.
   - **Partially Intersecting the Circle:** If a triangle has at least one vertex inside the circle but not all, it's partially intersecting. For these triangles, we need to count the lattice points that lie within both the triangle and the circle.

2. **Applying Pick's Theorem:**
   - **Pick's Theorem** states that for a simple polygon with integer vertices, the area \( A \) is related to the number of interior lattice points \( i \) and boundary lattice points \( b \) by \( A = i + \frac{b}{2} - 1 \).
   - Rearranging, the total number of lattice points (interior + boundary) is \( i + b = A + 1 + \frac{b}{2} \).
   - To compute this, calculate the area of the triangle using the shoelace formula and determine the number of boundary points by calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) of edge differences.

3. **Handling Partially Intersecting Triangles:**
   - For triangles partially within the circle, iterate over the bounding box of the triangle intersected with the circle.
   - For each lattice point in this region, check if it lies both inside the triangle and the circle.
   - Utilize efficient methods like the **Half-Plane Method** to determine if a point is inside the triangle.

4. **Optimization Considerations:**
   - Precompute necessary values like GCD to speed up boundary point calculations.
   - Use efficient algorithms for point-in-triangle checks to handle the large number of triangles within the constraints.

By classifying triangles and applying appropriate methods based on their classification, we can efficiently compute the required sum of lattice points.
