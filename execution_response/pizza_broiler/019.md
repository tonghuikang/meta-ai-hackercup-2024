**Key Findings:**

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to calculate the total number of lattice points that lie within both a given circle of radius \( R \) and multiple triangles representing pizza slices.
   - Each triangle is either entirely within the circle or partially intersects it in a connected region.

2. **Approach Overview:**
   - **Fully Inside Triangles:** For triangles entirely within the circle, we can use Pick's Theorem to calculate the number of lattice points. Pick's Theorem states that for a polygon with integer vertices:
     \[
     I = A - \frac{B}{2} + 1
     \]
     where \( I \) is the number of interior lattice points, \( A \) is the area, and \( B \) is the number of lattice points on the boundary.
     - **Area Calculation:** The area \( A \) can be calculated using the shoelace formula.
     - **Boundary Points:** The number of boundary lattice points for each edge can be found using the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the differences in coordinates.
     - **Total Points:** The total number of lattice points in the triangle is \( I + B \).
   
   - **Partially Intersecting Triangles:** For triangles intersecting the circle:
     - Determine the bounding box of the triangle and the circle.
     - Iterate over possible lattice points within this bounding box.
     - For each point, check if it lies within both the triangle and the circle.
     - Due to the high constraints (e.g., \( R \) up to \( 10^6 \)), this step requires optimization. However, given the problem constraints and the need for an efficient solution, we proceed with this method, assuming that most triangles are fully inside the circle and partial overlaps are minimal.

3. **Optimizations:**
   - **Fast Input Parsing:** Utilize efficient input methods to handle large inputs.
   - **Efficient Boundary Point Calculation:** Precompute GCDs or use optimized GCD calculations to speed up boundary point counts.
   - **Early Exclusion:** Quickly exclude triangles that are entirely outside the circle or have minimal overlapping regions.

4. **Assumptions:**
   - The majority of triangles are likely fully inside the circle, allowing the use of Pick's Theorem to compute lattice points efficiently.
   - Partially intersecting triangles are handled with enumeration within their bounding boxes, optimized as much as possible.
