To solve this problem, we need to compute the number of integer lattice points that are inside both the given triangles and the circle of radius \( R \) centered at the origin. The challenge is to do this efficiently for up to \( 10^6 \) triangles.

Here's a high-level plan:

1. **Compute the total number of integer points inside each triangle using Pick's Theorem**:
   - **Area \( A_T \)**: Compute the area of the triangle using the shoelace formula.
   - **Boundary points \( B \)**: Count the number of lattice points on the edges of the triangle.
   - **Interior points \( I \)**: Use Pick's Theorem:
     \[ I = A_T + 1 - \frac{B}{2} \]

2. **Compute the area \( A_{\text{in}} \) of the intersection between the triangle and the circle**:
   - This involves computational geometry techniques to compute the exact area of overlap.
   - We will:
     - **Intersect triangle edges with the circle**.
     - **Construct the intersection polygon**, which may include straight edges and arc segments.
     - **Compute the area** of this intersection polygon.

3. **Estimate the number of integer points within the intersection**:
   - Assume that the integer points are uniformly distributed over the triangle.
   - The estimated number of integer points in the intersection is:
     \[ N = I \times \frac{A_{\text{in}}}{A_T} \]

4. **Sum up the estimated counts for all triangles**.

**Key Findings and Implementation Details**:

- **Computing Line-Circle Intersections**: For each edge of the triangle, compute the intersection points with the circle. This involves solving a quadratic equation derived from plugging the parametric form of the line into the circle equation.

- **Constructing the Intersection Shape**: Use the intersection points to construct the shape representing the intersection area. This shape can have both straight edges and circular arcs.

- **Computing Area with Straight Edges and Arcs**: When calculating the area of such shapes, careful handling is required to correctly compute the contributions from both the polygonal parts and the circular segments.

- **Efficiency**: The computational complexity per triangle is acceptable since we only have to process a few edges per triangle (each triangle has 3 edges). 

- **Numerical Stability and Precision**: Be cautious with floating-point operations to avoid errors due to precision loss.

Now, let's implement the solution in Python.
