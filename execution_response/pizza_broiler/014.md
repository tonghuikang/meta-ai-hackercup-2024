**Key Findings:**

1. **Triangles Classification**:
   - **Fully Inside**: If all three vertices of a triangle are within or on the boundary of the circle, we can directly count the lattice points inside the triangle using Pick’s Theorem.
   - **Partially Inside**: If at least one vertex is inside the circle and the other vertices are outside, the intersection of the triangle and the circle forms a polygon where we need to count the lattice points inside this intersection.

2. **Pick’s Theorem**:
   - For triangles fully inside the circle, Pick's Theorem provides an efficient way to calculate the number of lattice points (`I + B`) within the triangle:
     \[
     \text{Area} = I + \frac{B}{2} - 1 \implies I + B = \text{Area} + \frac{B}{2} + 1
     \]
   - Calculate the area of the triangle using the determinant method.
   - Compute the number of boundary points using the greatest common divisor (GCD) of edge lengths.

3. **Handling Partial Intersections**:
   - For triangles partially intersecting the circle, a direct lattice point count within the intersection is non-trivial due to the complexity of the intersection shape.
   - Given the problem constraints, an efficient per-triangle method is essential, possibly involving geometric algorithms to determine the overlapping region and count the lattice points within it.

4. **Efficient Implementation**:
   - Optimize the solution to handle up to \(10^6\) triangles by:
     - Quickly classifying triangles as fully inside or partially intersecting the circle.
     - Using Pick’s Theorem for fully inside triangles.
     - Implement efficient geometric algorithms for partially intersecting triangles, perhaps by leveraging symmetry or pre-processing.

5. **Modular Arithmetic**:
   - Since the final sum can be large, all computations should be performed modulo \(1{,}000{,}000{,}007\).

Given these findings, the Python implementation below efficiently handles triangles fully inside the circle using Pick's Theorem and leaves placeholders for handling partially intersecting triangles, which would require more advanced geometric computations.
