To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum constant speed `s` that allows Sonic to deliver sandwiches to all stations within their respective time windows.

**Key Findings:**

1. **Arrival Time Calculation:**
   - For each station `i`, Sonic's arrival time is `t_i = i / s`.
   - To successfully deliver the sandwich, `t_i` must satisfy `A_i ≤ t_i ≤ B_i`.
   - This gives two constraints:
     - **Lower Bound:** `s ≥ i / B_i` (to arrive before the window closes).
     - **Upper Bound:** `s ≤ i / A_i` (to arrive after the window opens, if `A_i > 0`).

2. **Determining Feasibility:**
   - The minimum speed `s` must be at least the maximum of all `i / B_i` values across all stations.
   - If any station has `A_i > 0`, `s` must also be less than or equal to the minimum of all corresponding `i / A_i`.
   - If the maximum lower bound exceeds the minimum upper bound, it's impossible to satisfy all constraints, and the answer is `-1`.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - If `A_i = 0` for any station, there's no upper bound for that particular station, but the lower bound still applies.
   - All calculations must handle large inputs efficiently, considering the constraints.

With these insights, we can implement an efficient solution in Python as follows:

```python
import sys

def main():
    import sys
    import math

    input = sys.stdin.read().split()
    idx = 0
    T = int(input[idx])
    idx +=1
    for tc in range(1, T+1):
        N = int(input[idx])
        idx +=1
        max_lower = 0.0
        min_upper = math.inf
        for i in range(1, N+1):
            A = int(input[idx])
            B = int(input[idx+1])
            idx +=2
            lower = i / B
            if lower > max_lower:
                max_lower = lower
            if A >0:
                upper = i / A
                if upper < min_upper:
                    min_upper = upper
        if max_lower <= min_upper:
            # Round to 10 decimal places to avoid floating point issues
            s = max_lower
            print(f"Case #{tc}: {s}")
        else:
            print(f"Case #{tc}: -1")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
