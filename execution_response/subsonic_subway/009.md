**Key Findings:**

1. **Delivery Time Calculation:** For each station \(i\), Sonic needs to reach it in a time \( \frac{i}{s} \), where \(s\) is his constant speed in miles per second.

2. **Speed Constraints per Station:** 
   - To deliver within the window \([A_i, B_i]\), the speed \(s\) must satisfy:
     \[
     A_i \leq \frac{i}{s} \leq B_i
     \]
     This implies:
     \[
     \frac{i}{B_i} \leq s \leq \frac{i}{A_i} \quad (\text{if } A_i > 0)
     \]
     If \(A_i = 0\), the upper bound for \(s\) is effectively infinity.

3. **Overall Speed Interval:** 
   - The permissible speed \(s\) must lie within the intersection of all individual speed intervals. 
   - Therefore, the minimum feasible speed \(s\) is the **maximum** of all lower bounds \(\frac{i}{B_i}\), and the maximum allowed speed is the **minimum** of all upper bounds \(\frac{i}{A_i}\).

4. **Feasibility Check:** 
   - If the maximum lower bound is less than or equal to the minimum upper bound, then a feasible speed exists, and the minimum required speed is the maximum lower bound.
   - If not, it's impossible to deliver to all stations within their respective windows, and the result should be \(-1\).

5. **Edge Cases:** 
   - Handle cases where \(A_i = 0\) appropriately by considering the upper bound as infinity.
   - Ensure precision in floating-point calculations to meet the error tolerance.

**Python Code:**

```python
import sys

def solve():
    import sys
    import math

    input = sys.stdin.read().split()
    idx = 0
    T = int(input[idx]); idx +=1
    for tc in range(1, T+1):
        N = int(input[idx]); idx +=1
        max_lower = 0.0
        min_upper = float('inf')
        for i in range(1, N+1):
            A_i = int(input[idx]); idx +=1
            B_i = int(input[idx]); idx +=1
            lower = i / B_i
            max_lower = max(max_lower, lower)
            if A_i ==0:
                upper = float('inf')
            else:
                upper = i / A_i
            min_upper = min(min_upper, upper)
        if max_lower <= min_upper + 1e-12:
            # To handle floating point precision, add a small epsilon
            result = max_lower
            # Clamp to min_upper in case floating points slightly exceed
            if result > min_upper:
                result = min_upper
            print(f"Case #{tc}: {result}")
        else:
            print(f"Case #{tc}: -1")
```
