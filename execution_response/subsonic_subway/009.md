**Key Findings:**

1. **Understanding the Constraints:**
   - Sonic needs to deliver sandwiches to `N` stations located at distances `1` to `N` miles.
   - For each station `i`, Sonic must arrive within the time window `[A_i, B_i]` seconds.
   - Since Sonic runs at a constant speed `S` (miles per second), the time to reach station `i` is `T_i = i / S`.

2. **Deriving Speed Constraints:**
   - To meet the delivery window at station `i`, the following must hold:
     \[
     A_i \leq \frac{i}{S} \leq B_i
     \]
     Rearranging the inequalities to solve for `S`:
     \[
     S \geq \frac{i}{B_i} \quad \text{and} \quad S \leq \frac{i}{A_i} \quad \text{(if } A_i > 0 \text{)}
     \]
   - For each station, `S` must be at least `i/B_i`. Additionally, if `A_i > 0`, `S` must not exceed `i/A_i`.

3. **Determining the Feasibility and Minimum Speed:**
   - **Lower Bound:** The minimum possible speed `S` must be the maximum of all `i/B_i` values across all stations.
   - **Upper Bound:** The speed `S` must also be less than or equal to the minimum of all `i/A_i` values where `A_i > 0`. If `A_i = 0`, thereâ€™s no upper bound from that station.
   - **Feasibility Check:** If the calculated lower bound exceeds the upper bound, it's impossible to find a suitable speed `S`, and the answer is `-1`. Otherwise, the minimal feasible speed is the lower bound.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **`A_i = 0`:** This situation means there's no lower limit on the delivery time, but Sonic must still meet the upper time constraint (`S >= i/B_i`).
   - Ensure that divisions by zero are handled gracefully when `A_i = 0`.

5. **Efficiency Considerations:**
   - Given the constraints on `N` (up to 1,000,000 per test case and a total of 5,000,000 across all test cases), the solution must process input and compute results efficiently, preferably in linear time.

Based on these findings, the following Python code efficiently computes the minimum required speed for each test case or determines if it's impossible.

```python
import sys

def main():
    import sys
    import math

    input = sys.stdin.read().split()
    ptr = 0
    T = int(input[ptr]); ptr +=1

    for test_case in range(1, T+1):
        N = int(input[ptr]); ptr +=1

        max_lower = 0.0
        min_upper = math.inf
        impossible = False

        for i in range(1, N+1):
            A = int(input[ptr]); ptr +=1
            B = int(input[ptr]); ptr +=1

            # Calculate the lower bound S >= i / B
            lower = i / B
            if lower > max_lower:
                max_lower = lower

            # Calculate the upper bound S <= i / A, if A >0
            if A >0:
                upper = i / A
                if upper < min_upper:
                    min_upper = upper
            else:
                # If A ==0, no upper bound from this station
                pass

        # After processing all stations, determine
        if max_lower <= min_upper:
            # Round to 10 decimal places to handle floating precision
            # But output as per problem's requirements
            print(f"Case #{test_case}: {max_lower}")
        else:
            print(f"Case #{test_case}: -1")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
