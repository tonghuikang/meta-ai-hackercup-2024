To solve this problem, we need to understand and compute the feasible ranges of speeds \(V\) for Sonic to deliver sandwiches to all stations within the given time windows.

**Key findings when solving the problem:**

1. **Feasible Speed Intervals per Station:**
   For each station \(i\), located \(i\) miles away, Sonic must arrive within the time window \([A_i, B_i]\). Traveling at a constant speed \(V\), he reaches station \(i\) at time \(t_i = \frac{i}{V}\). Therefore, the acceptable speeds for station \(i\) satisfy:
   \[
   A_i \leq \frac{i}{V} \leq B_i
   \]
   Rearranging:
   \[
   V \geq \frac{i}{B_i} \quad \text{and} \quad V \leq \frac{i}{A_i} \quad (\text{if } A_i > 0)
   \]

   - **Lower Bound (\(L_i\))**: \(V \geq \frac{i}{B_i}\)
   - **Upper Bound (\(R_i\))**:
     - If \(A_i > 0\), \(V \leq \frac{i}{A_i}\)
     - If \(A_i = 0\), \(R_i = \infty\) (no upper bound)

2. **Overall Feasible Speed Interval:**
   Sonic's speed must satisfy all individual intervals simultaneously. Therefore, the overall feasible speed interval is:
   \[
   V \in \left[ \max_i \left( \frac{i}{B_i} \right), \min_{\substack{i \\ A_i > 0}} \left( \frac{i}{A_i} \right) \right]
   \]
   - **Note**: If the maximum lower bound exceeds the minimum upper bound, the intervals do not overlap, and it's impossible to find a constant speed satisfying all constraints.

3. **Finding the Minimum Constant Speed:**
   - If the intervals overlap, the minimum constant speed is the maximum of all lower bounds (\(\max(L_i)\)).
   - If they do not overlap (\(\max(L_i) > \min(R_i)\)), the answer is \(-1\).

4. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - When \(A_i = 0\), \(R_i = \infty\), so there is no upper speed limit for that station.
   - B_i is always greater than \(A_i\) and \(A_i \geq 0\), so division by \(B_i\) is safe.

5. **Precision Considerations:**
   - Since acceptable error is \(1 \times 10^{-6}\), we must ensure that the calculations maintain sufficient precision.
   - Use floating-point arithmetic with careful handling of divisions to prevent rounding errors.

**Python Code:**

```python
T = int(input())
for case_num in range(1, T + 1):
    N = int(input())
    max_L = 0.0
    min_R = float('inf')
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        A_i_str, B_i_str = input().strip().split()
        A_i, B_i = int(A_i_str), int(B_i_str)
        L_i = i / B_i  # Lower bound for speed at station i
        max_L = max(max_L, L_i)
        if A_i > 0:
            R_i = i / A_i  # Upper bound for speed at station i
            min_R = min(min_R, R_i)
        # If A_i == 0, R_i is infinite (no upper limit)

    if max_L <= min_R:
        print(f"Case #{case_num}: {max_L}")
    else:
        print(f"Case #{case_num}: -1")
```

This code reads each test case, calculates the feasible speed intervals for each station, and determines if there is an overlapping interval where Sonic can find a constant speed to deliver sandwiches to all stations. If such an interval exists, it outputs the minimum required speed; otherwise, it outputs `-1`.
