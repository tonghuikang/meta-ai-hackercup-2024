**Key Findings:**

1. **Wildcard Expansion:** Each wildcard character '`?`' in the strings can be replaced by any uppercase Latin letter, resulting in multiple possible strings. Specifically, a string with `k` wildcards represents \(26^k\) possible strings.

2. **Trie Construction Efficiency:** Instead of explicitly generating all possible strings (which is computationally infeasible due to the exponential number of possibilities), we can build the trie incrementally by considering all possible choices at each wildcard position. This is done by recursively branching out for each possible letter replacement.

3. **Shared Prefixes:** Since multiple strings (or multiple expansions of wildcard strings) can share common prefixes, the trie naturally reuses nodes for these shared prefixes. This significantly reduces the total number of nodes compared to the sum of nodes for each individual string.

4. **Modular Arithmetic:** Given the potentially large number of nodes, all calculations are performed modulo \(998{,}244{,}353\) to prevent integer overflow and to meet the problem's requirements.

5. **Recursive Insertion with Memoization:** To efficiently handle the insertion of wildcard strings into the trie, a recursive approach is employed. This involves exploring all possible character substitutions for wildcards and ensuring that shared paths in the trie are counted only once.

6. **Performance Considerations:** Although the number of test cases \(T\) can be as large as \(10^5\), each individual test case is manageable due to the constraints on \(N\) and \(|S_i|\). Efficient trie operations and careful handling of wildcards ensure that the solution runs within acceptable time limits.

    return list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))

    __slots__ = ['children']
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = {}

    from collections import deque
    T_and_rest = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()
    T = int(T_and_rest[0])
    idx = 1
    for test_case in range(1, T+1):
        N = int(T_and_rest[idx])
        idx +=1
        strings = []
        for _ in range(N):
            strings.append(T_and_rest[idx])
            idx +=1
        root = TrieNode()
        total_nodes = 1
        for s in strings:
            stack = [(root, 0)]
            while stack:
                node, pos = stack.pop()
                if pos == len(s):
                    continue
                c = s[pos]
                if c == '?':

                            total_nodes = (total_nodes +1) % MOD
