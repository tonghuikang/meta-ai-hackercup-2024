To solve the problem, we observe the following:

1. **Trie Structure and Prefixes:** A trie represents the set of all prefixes of the inserted strings. The total number of nodes in the trie equals the number of unique prefixes among all the strings represented by the wildcard patterns.

2. **Handling Wildcards Efficiently:** Given the presence of wildcards (`?`), substituting all possibilities directly isn't feasible due to the exponential number of combinations. Instead, we need an efficient way to explore all possible prefixes without enumerating every string.

3. **State Representation with Masking:** We can represent each state in our search as a tuple `(pos, mask)`, where:
   - `pos` is the current position in the strings.
   - `mask` is a bitmask indicating which patterns are active (i.e., patterns still matching the current prefix).

4. **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** We perform BFS to traverse through possible prefixes. At each state, we:
   - Consider all possible characters (`'A'` to `'Z'`).
   - Update the mask based on which patterns can accept the character at the current position.
   - Enqueue new states `(pos+1, new_mask)` for further exploration.

5. **Avoiding Redundant Computations:** We maintain a `visited` set to avoid processing the same state multiple times, ensuring each unique prefix is counted exactly once.

6. **Managing State Explosion:** Although the theoretical number of states is high (`positions * 2^N`), in practice, many states are unreachable due to pattern constraints. Hence, the actual number of states explored remains manageable.

7. **Counting Unique Nodes:** Each unique state corresponds to a unique node in the trie. By counting the number of unique states visited during BFS, we obtain the total number of nodes in the trie.

8. **Modular Arithmetic:** Since the answer can be large, we take the output modulo `998244353` as per the problem statement.

Here's the Python code implementing the above approach:

```python
MOD = 998244353

            max_len = 0
            for _ in range(N):
                s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()
                S.append(s)

                    initial_mask |= (1 << i)
            queue = deque()
            queue.append((0, initial_mask))
            total_nodes = 0
            while queue:
                pos, mask = queue.popleft()
                if (pos, mask) in visited:
                    continue
                visited.add((pos, mask))
                total_nodes += 1
                # For each possible character c
                for c in range(26):
                    new_mask = 0
                    for i in range(N):
                        if (mask & (1 << i)) == 0:
                            continue
                        if pos >= len(S[i]):
                            continue
                        ch = S[i][pos]
                        if ch == '?' or ch == chr(ord('A') + c):
                            new_mask |= (1 << i)
                    if new_mask != 0:
                        queue.append((pos +1, new_mask))
            total_nodes %= MOD
            print(f"Case #{test_case}: {total_nodes}")
    threading.Thread(target=main).start()
