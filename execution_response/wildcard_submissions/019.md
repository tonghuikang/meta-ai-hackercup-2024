**Key Findings:**

1. **Trie Structure with Wildcards:**
   - Each wildcard `'?'` in a string can represent any of the 26 uppercase Latin letters.
   - When inserting wildcard strings into the trie, each `'?'` introduces branches for all possible letters, effectively creating multiple paths in the trie.

2. **Efficient Representation:**
   - To handle multiple wildcards efficiently, we can represent the trie nodes using a dictionary where each key is a character, and the value is the corresponding child node.
   - This allows for dynamic creation and reuse of nodes when paths overlap due to common prefixes or different wildcard substitutions.

3. **Counting Unique Nodes:**
   - Initialize the trie with a root node.
   - For each string, iterate through its characters, handling wildcards by branching into all possible letters.
   - Use a set or a similar structure to ensure that nodes are only counted once, even if they are reached through different paths.

4. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - Since the number of nodes can be large, perform all calculations modulo \(998{,}244{,}353\) to prevent integer overflow and to conform to the problem's output requirements.

5. **Optimization for Large Test Cases:**
   - Given the constraints (\(T \leq 10^5\)), it's crucial to process each test case independently and efficiently.
   - Utilize memoization or caching strategies where possible to avoid redundant computations, especially when multiple test cases share similar patterns.

6. **Handling Multiple Test Cases:**
   - Since test cases are independent, reset the trie for each test case.
   - Ensure that the solution reads input efficiently, especially when dealing with a large number of test cases.

**Python Code:**

```python
import sys
import threading

MOD = 998244353

def main():
    import sys
    sys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)
    T = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    for test_case in range(1, T + 1):
        N = int(sys.stdin.readline())
        strings = [sys.stdin.readline().strip() for _ in range(N)]

        trie = {}
        node_count = 1  # root node

        for s in strings:
            nodes = [(trie, 0)]
            while nodes:
                current_node, index = nodes.pop()
                if index == len(s):
                    continue
                char = s[index]
                if char == '?':
                    for c in 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ':
                        if c not in current_node:
                            current_node[c] = {}
                            node_count = (node_count + 1) % MOD
                        nodes.append((current_node[c], index + 1))
                else:
                    if char not in current_node:
                        current_node[char] = {}
                        node_count = (node_count + 1) % MOD
                    nodes.append((current_node[char], index + 1))

        print(f"Case #{test_case}: {node_count}")
