**Key Findings:**

1. **Trie Structure with Wildcards:**
   - Each wildcard character `'?'` in a string can represent any uppercase Latin letter (`'A'` to `'Z'`), effectively branching the trie into 26 possible paths at that position.
   - Fixed characters lead to a single path in the trie.

2. **Efficient Trie Construction:**
   - To handle multiple wildcard strings efficiently, we utilize a trie where each node represents a unique prefix.
   - By iteratively inserting each string, considering the branching caused by wildcards, we can count the total number of unique nodes.

3. **Handling Large Input Sizes:**
   - Given the constraints (`T` up to `10^5`, `N` up to `25`, and string lengths up to `100`), it is crucial to optimize the trie operations.
   - Using dictionary-based tries in Python can be slow for very large inputs. However, due to the problem's nature and constraints, an optimized approach with careful handling of wildcards can work within acceptable time limits.

4. **Modulo Operation:**
   - Since the number of nodes can be large, all counts are computed modulo `998244353` to prevent integer overflow and conform to the problem's requirements.

Below is the Python implementation that follows these findings:

```python
import sys
import threading

def main():
    import sys
    sys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)
    MOD = 998244353

    T = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    for test_case in range(1, T+1):
        N = int(sys.stdin.readline())
        strings = [sys.stdin.readline().strip() for _ in range(N)]
        trie = {}
        node_count = 1  # start with root
        for s in strings:
            stack = [(trie, 0)]
            while stack:
                current_node, pos = stack.pop()
                if pos == len(s):
                    continue
                c = s[pos]
                if c == '?':
                    for ch in 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ':
                        if ch not in current_node:
                            current_node[ch] = {}
                            node_count = (node_count + 1) % MOD
                        stack.append((current_node[ch], pos+1))
                else:
                    ch = c
                    if ch not in current_node:
                        current_node[ch] = {}
                        node_count = (node_count + 1) % MOD
                    stack.append((current_node[ch], pos+1))
        print(f"Case #{test_case}: {node_count % MOD}")

threading.Thread(target=main).start()
```

**Explanation of the Code:**

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The input is read using `sys.stdin` for efficiency, especially given the potential large size of input data.
   - For each test case, we read `N` wildcard strings.

2. **Trie Initialization:**
   - We start with an empty trie represented as a nested dictionary.
   - `node_count` is initialized to `1` to account for the root node.

3. **Inserting Strings into the Trie:**
   - For each string, we use a stack-based iterative approach to handle the branching caused by wildcards.
   - If the current character is a fixed letter, we follow or create the corresponding path in the trie.
   - If the character is a `'?'`, we branch into all 26 possible uppercase letters, creating new nodes as necessary.
   - Each new node creation increments the `node_count`, ensuring we stay within the modulo constraint.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all strings in a test case, we output the total number of nodes modulo `998244353` in the specified format.

This approach ensures that we efficiently count all unique prefixes across all possible expansions of the wildcard strings within each test case.
