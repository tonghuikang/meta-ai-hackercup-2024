**Key Findings:**

1. **Wildcard Expansion Complexity**:
    - Each wildcard (`?`) in a string can be replaced by any of the 26 uppercase English letters.
    - Directly expanding all possible strings from wildcards is computationally infeasible, especially with multiple wildcards and multiple strings.

2. **Trie Structure Optimization**:
    - Instead of enumerating all possible strings, we can represent the trie efficiently by considering the set of possible characters at each position.
    - By traversing the trie and branching only when necessary (i.e., when new character possibilities arise due to wildcards), we can count unique nodes without generating all strings.

3. **Efficient Trie Insertion with Wildcards**:
    - Implement a trie where each node represents a prefix.
    - When inserting a string with wildcards, handle each character position by considering all possible substitutions (`A` to `Z` for `?`).
    - Use memoization or dynamic programming to avoid redundant computations when multiple strings share common prefixes.

4. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**:
    - Given that the number of test cases \(T\) can be as large as \(10^5\), it's crucial to process each test case efficiently.
    - Initialize a fresh trie for each test case to ensure that node counts are isolated per case.

5. **Modulo Operation for Large Numbers**:
    - Since the number of nodes can be very large, all counts are computed modulo \(998{,}244{,}353\) to prevent integer overflow and to meet the problem's requirements.
