**Key Findings:**

1. **Trie Structure:** A trie is used to store prefixes of strings efficiently. Each node represents a unique prefix, and edges represent characters leading to further prefixes.

2. **Handling Wildcards:** Wildcards (`?`) in the strings can represent any uppercase Latin letter (26 possibilities). This introduces branching in the trie, as each wildcard can lead to multiple paths.

3. **Efficient Insertion:** Instead of generating all possible strings from wildcards (which can be computationally expensive due to exponential growth), we traverse the trie by considering all possible characters at each wildcard position.

4. **Counting Nodes:** We keep track of unique nodes in the trie by traversing existing paths and creating new nodes only when necessary. This ensures that we count each unique prefix exactly once.

5. **Modulo Operation:** Since the number of nodes can be very large, all counts are taken modulo \(998{,}244{,}353\) to keep the numbers manageable.

6. **Optimized Data Structures:** Using dictionaries to represent child nodes allows for efficient lookup and insertion, which is crucial given the constraints on the number of test cases and string lengths.
