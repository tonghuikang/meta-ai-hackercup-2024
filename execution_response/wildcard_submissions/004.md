**Key Findings:**

1. **Trie Structure with Wildcards**:
    - A standard trie efficiently stores multiple strings by sharing common prefixes.
    - Wildcards (`?`) introduce multiple possibilities at each position, effectively branching the trie.

2. **Handling Wildcards**:
    - When inserting a string with wildcards, each `?` can represent any of the 26 uppercase Latin letters.
    - This means that a single wildcard can lead to 26 different paths in the trie.

3. **Efficient Trie Implementation**:
    - Given the constraints (`T` up to \(10^5\), `N` up to 25, and string lengths up to 100), it's crucial to implement the trie efficiently.
    - Utilize a tree structure where each node has an array of 26 children corresponding to each uppercase letter.
    - To handle wildcards, recursively explore all possible branches for each `?`.

4. **Counting Nodes**:
    - Initialize the trie with a root node representing the empty string.
    - For each string pattern, traverse the trie, creating new nodes as necessary.
    - When encountering a specific character, follow the corresponding child.
    - For a wildcard, iterate over all 26 possible children, branching the insertion process accordingly.
    - Use memoization or dynamic programming to avoid redundant computations during branching.

5. **Modular Arithmetic**:
    - Since the number of nodes can be large, perform all calculations modulo \(998{,}244{,}353\).

6. **Optimization Considerations**:
    - Given that `N` and the lengths of the strings are small, but `T` is large, ensure that the per-test-case processing is optimized to handle up to \(2.5 \times 10^6\) operations efficiently in Python.

        node_count = 1
