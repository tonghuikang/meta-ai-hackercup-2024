**Key Findings:**

1. **Trie Structure and Prefixes:**
   - A trie node represents a unique prefix of strings inserted into it.
   - The total number of nodes in the trie corresponds to the number of unique prefixes across all inserted strings.

2. **Handling Wildcards:**
   - Wildcard characters (`?`) in the strings can represent any uppercase Latin letter (`A` to `Z`).
   - Each wildcard increases the branching factor of the trie, as multiple possible paths can be created from that position.

3. **Counting Unique Prefixes:**
   - For multiple wildcard strings, overlapping prefixes must be counted only once to avoid overcounting.
   - To efficiently count unique prefixes without enumerating all possible strings (which is computationally infeasible due to the exponential number of possibilities), we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach with bitmasking.
   
4. **Bitmask Representation:**
   - Each string in a test case can be represented by a bit in a bitmask, allowing efficient tracking of active strings that can contribute to the current prefix.
   - At each depth (prefix length), determine the possible letters by aggregating the allowed characters from all active strings.
   
5. **BFS Traversal:**
   - Initialize the trie with the root node representing the empty string.
   - Use BFS to traverse possible prefixes, updating the count of unique nodes by considering all possible extensions based on the current set of active strings.
   - Utilize memoization (via a `visited` set) to avoid revisiting the same state (combination of active strings and depth).

6. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - Since the number of nodes can be large, all counts are computed modulo \(998{,}244{,}353\) as required.

7. **Efficiency Considerations:**
   - Given the constraints (\(T \leq 10^5\), \(N \leq 25\), and \(|S_i| \leq 100\)), the solution must efficiently handle a large number of test cases by leveraging bitmasking and BFS to minimize redundant computations.
