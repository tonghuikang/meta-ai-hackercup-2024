To solve this problem, the primary goal is to calculate the number of unique nodes in a trie after inserting multiple wildcard strings. Each wildcard string can represent multiple actual strings due to the presence of `?` characters, which can be replaced by any uppercase Latin letter.

### Key Findings:

1. **Trie Structure**:
   - A trie is a tree-like data structure where each node represents a prefix of a string.
   - The root node represents the empty string `''`.
   - Each edge from a node represents a possible next character in the strings.

2. **Handling Wildcards**:
   - A wildcard `?` in a string can represent any of the 26 uppercase Latin letters.
   - When inserting a string with wildcards, multiple paths in the trie are created, corresponding to all possible substitutions of the wildcards.

3. **Efficient Trie Implementation**:
   - Given the constraints (especially `T` up to \(10^5\) and multiple strings with lengths up to 100), it's crucial to implement the trie efficiently.
   - Instead of using dictionaries for child nodes (which are slower in Python), we can represent child nodes using fixed-size lists or arrays.
   - Each node can be represented by a list of 26 integers, each corresponding to a child node for a particular letter.
   - Using integers to track node indices ensures faster access and minimal memory overhead.

4. **Modular Arithmetic**:
   - Since the number of nodes can be large, all calculations are done modulo \(998{,}244{,}353\) to prevent integer overflow and to comply with the output requirements.

5. **Per-Test-Case Isolation**:
   - Each test case requires an independent trie. Therefore, the trie must be reset for each test case to ensure that node counts do not interfere across different cases.

6. **Optimization Considerations**:
   - Given Python's inherent speed limitations for highly iterative tasks, care must be taken to minimize per-operation overhead.
   - Utilizing precomputed values, efficient data structures, and avoiding unnecessary operations can help in managing the time complexity.

### Python Code:

```python
import sys
import threading

def main():
    import sys
    import sys
    sys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)
    T = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    MOD = 998244353
    for tc in range(1, T+1):
        N = int(sys.stdin.readline())
        strings = [sys.stdin.readline().strip() for _ in range(N)]
        trie = [{}]
        node_count = 1
        for s in strings:
            current_nodes = [0]
            for c in s:
                next_nodes = []
                if c == '?':
                    letters = [chr(ord('A') + i) for i in range(26)]
                else:
                    letters = [c]
                for node in current_nodes:
                    for letter in letters:
                        if letter not in trie[node]:
                            trie.append({})
                            trie[node][letter] = node_count
                            node_count +=1
                        next_nodes.append(trie[node][letter])
                current_nodes = next_nodes
            # To prevent the list from growing too large unnecessarily, optionally clear next_nodes
        print(f"Case #{tc}: {node_count % MOD}")

threading.Thread(target=main).start()
