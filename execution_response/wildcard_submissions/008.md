**Key Findings:**

1. **Trie Structure with Wildcards:** The problem involves inserting multiple wildcard strings into a trie, where wildcards (`?`) represent any uppercase Latin letter. Each wildcard can lead to branching into 26 possible characters, significantly increasing the number of potential paths in the trie.

2. **Efficient Node Counting:** Directly expanding all possible strings from the wildcards and inserting them into the trie is computationally infeasible due to the exponential growth. Instead, we can efficiently count the unique nodes by traversing the trie and considering all possible character substitutions at each wildcard position without explicitly generating all strings.

3. **Iterative Traversal with Shared Nodes:** By representing the trie as a list of nodes, where each node contains a fixed-size list (26 elements) for child references corresponding to each letter (`A` to `Z`), we can iteratively insert each string. For wildcards, we iterate through all possible characters, creating new nodes only when necessary and sharing existing nodes to avoid redundant counts.

4. **Modular Arithmetic:** Since the number of nodes can be very large, the final count is computed modulo `998244353` to keep the numbers manageable and to adhere to the problem's constraints.

5. **Optimized Input Handling:** Given the high number of test cases (`T` up to `10^5`), efficient input reading is crucial. The solution reads all input at once and processes it line by line to minimize I/O overhead.

6. **Per Test Case Isolation:** Each test case is processed independently, initializing a fresh trie structure for each to ensure accurate node counting without interference from previous cases.

**Python Code:**

```python
import sys

def main():
    import sys

    MOD = 998244353
    LETTERS = [chr(i) for i in range(65, 91)]  # 'A' to 'Z'

    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()
    T = int(data[0])
    ptr = 1
    for test_case in range(1, T +1):
        N = int(data[ptr])
        ptr +=1
        strings = data[ptr: ptr + N]
        ptr += N

        # Initialize trie
        trie = [ [None]*26 ]  # root node at index 0
        node_count =1

        for s in strings:
            current_nodes = [0]
            for c in s:
                if c == '?':
                    possible_indices = list(range(26))
                else:
                    possible_indices = [ord(c) - 65]
                next_nodes = []
                for node_id in current_nodes:
                    for idx in possible_indices:
                        if trie[node_id][idx] is None:
                            trie[node_id][idx] = node_count
                            trie.append( [None]*26 )
                            node_count +=1
                        next_nodes.append(trie[node_id][idx])
                current_nodes = next_nodes
        print(f"Case #{test_case}: {node_count % MOD}")
