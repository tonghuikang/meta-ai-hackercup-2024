**Key Findings:**

To solve the problem of counting the number of unique nodes in a trie formed by multiple wildcard strings, we can approach it by considering the union of all possible prefixes generated by the strings. Here are the main insights:

1. **Trie Structure and Prefixes:**
   - A trie is built by inserting all possible strings derived from the wildcard strings.
   - Each node in the trie represents a unique prefix of some string(s).
   - The total number of unique nodes is equivalent to the number of distinct prefixes across all possible strings represented by the wildcard strings.

2. **Handling Wildcards:**
   - Wildcards (`?`) in the strings can represent any uppercase Latin letter (`'A'` to `'Z'`).
   - For each position in a string, the set of possible characters is the union of all characters allowed by all strings at that position.
   
3. **Efficient Trie Construction:**
   - Given the constraints (up to \(10^5\) test cases, each with up to 25 strings of length up to 100), it's crucial to implement the trie construction efficiently.
   - Represent the trie using a list where each node is a dictionary mapping characters to child node indices. This allows for fast lookups and insertions.
   - For each test case:
     - Initialize the trie with a root node.
     - Iterate through each wildcard string, expanding it by replacing wildcards with all possible letters and inserting these paths into the trie.
     - Count the number of unique nodes created during this process.

4. **Modulo Operation:**
   - Since the number of nodes can be very large, all counts are computed modulo \(998{,}244{,}353\).

By leveraging these insights, we can construct the trie for each test case and efficiently count the unique nodes required.

```python
import sys
import threading

def main():
    import sys
    import sys
    sys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)
    MOD = 998244353
    T = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    for test_case in range(1, T + 1):
        N = int(sys.stdin.readline())
        S = [sys.stdin.readline().strip() for _ in range(N)]
        trie = [{}]
        node_count = 1
        for s in S:
            stack = [(0, 0)]  # (current_node, position in string)
            while stack:
                current_node, pos = stack.pop()
                if pos == len(s):
                    continue
                char = s[pos]
                if char == '?':
                    possibilities = [chr(ord('A') + i) for i in range(26)]
                else:
                    possibilities = [char]
                for c in possibilities:
                    if c not in trie[current_node]:
                        trie.append({})
                        trie[current_node][c] = node_count
                        node_count += 1
                    child_node = trie[current_node][c]
                    stack.append((child_node, pos + 1))
        print(f"Case #{test_case}: {node_count % MOD}")
