**Key Findings:**

1. **Trie Structure and Prefix Sharing:** A trie efficiently represents prefixes of strings. When inserting multiple strings, common prefixes are shared, reducing the total number of nodes needed. 

2. **Handling Wildcards:** Wildcard characters (`?`) represent any uppercase letter. Instead of expanding all possible strings explicitly (which is computationally expensive), we can handle wildcards by branching for each possible letter during trie construction.

3. **Efficient Trie Implementation:** Given the constraints (up to \(10^5\) test cases, each with up to 25 strings of length 100), it's crucial to implement the trie efficiently. Using a compact representation for trie nodes (e.g., lists with fixed size for child pointers) and avoiding unnecessary object creation can help manage memory and speed.

4. **Modular Arithmetic:** Since the number of nodes can be large, all calculations should be performed modulo \(998244353\) to prevent integer overflow and to comply with the problem's requirements.

5. **Per Test Case Processing:** Each test case is independent. Reinitializing the trie for each test case ensures that results do not interfere across cases.

**Python Code:**

```python
import sys
import threading

def main():
    import sys
    sys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)
    MOD = 998244353

    T = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    for test_case in range(1, T + 1):
        N = int(sys.stdin.readline())
        strings = [sys.stdin.readline().strip() for _ in range(N)]

        # Define the trie as nested dictionaries
        trie = {}
        count = 1  # Start with root node

        for s in strings:
            def insert(node, pos):
                nonlocal count
                if pos == len(s):
                    return
                c = s[pos]
                if c == '?':
                    keys = [chr(ord('A') + i) for i in range(26)]
                else:
                    keys = [c]
                for ch in keys:
                    if ch not in node:
                        node[ch] = {}
                        count = (count + 1) % MOD
                    insert(node[ch], pos + 1)

            insert(trie, 0)

        print(f"Case #{test_case}: {count % MOD}")
