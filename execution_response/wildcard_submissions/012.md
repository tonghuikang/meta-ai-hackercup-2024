When solving this problem, the primary challenge is efficiently managing wildcard strings (strings containing `?`) that represent multiple possible strings. Instead of generating every possible string (which is computationally infeasible due to the potential exponential number of combinations), we can build a trie incrementally while accounting for wildcards.

**Key Findings:**

1. **Trie Structure:** 
   - A trie is a tree-like data structure where each node represents a prefix of inserted strings.
   - The root node represents the empty string `''`.
   - Each edge represents a character, and children nodes represent extensions of the prefix.

2. **Handling Wildcards:**
   - When inserting a character that is a specific letter, we traverse or create the corresponding child node.
   - When inserting a `?`, it represents any uppercase letter (26 possibilities). For each `?`, we branch out to all possible child nodes (`A` to `Z`).

3. **Counting Nodes Efficiently:**
   - Initialize the trie with only the root node.
   - For each string with wildcards, recursively traverse the trie:
     - At each character position:
       - If the character is fixed, proceed accordingly.
       - If it's a `?`, iterate through all possible uppercase letters.
     - Only count and create nodes that do not already exist in the trie.
   - Use a recursive approach with memoization to avoid redundant computations and keep track of new nodes created.

4. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - Since the number of nodes can be very large, perform all additions modulo `998244353` to avoid overflow and adhere to the problem's constraints.

5. **Efficiency Considerations:**
   - Given constraints (`N` up to 25 and string lengths up to 100), a recursive approach is feasible without exceeding Python's recursion limits.
   - The trie efficiently shares common prefixes among different strings, minimizing the total number of nodes.

With these insights, the following Python code implements the solution:

```python
import sys
import threading

def main():
    import sys
    sys.setrecursionlimit(1000000)
    MOD = 998244353

    T = int(sys.stdin.readline())

    for test_case in range(1, T + 1):
        N = int(sys.stdin.readline())
        strings = [sys.stdin.readline().strip() for _ in range(N)]

        # Define the trie node
        class TrieNode:
            __slots__ = ['children']
            def __init__(self):
                self.children = {}

        root = TrieNode()
        total_nodes = 1  # Start with root

        for s in strings:
            def insert(pos, node):
                nonlocal total_nodes
                if pos == len(s):
                    return
                c = s[pos]
                if c != '?':
                    if c not in node.children:
                        node.children[c] = TrieNode()
                        total_nodes = (total_nodes + 1) % MOD
                    insert(pos + 1, node.children[c])
                else:
                    for char in 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ':
                        if char not in node.children:
                            node.children[char] = TrieNode()
                            total_nodes = (total_nodes + 1) % MOD
                        insert(pos + 1, node.children[char])

            insert(0, root)

        print(f"Case #{test_case}: {total_nodes}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    threading.Thread(target=main).start()
```
