When solving this problem, several key findings and strategies are essential to devise an efficient solution:

1. **Trie Structure and Shared Prefixes**:
   - A trie efficiently represents a set of strings by sharing common prefixes. Each node corresponds to a unique prefix.
   - When inserting multiple strings, overlapping prefixes allow us to share nodes, reducing the total number of nodes.

2. **Handling Wildcards (`?`)**:
   - A wildcard character (`?`) can represent any uppercase letter from 'A' to 'Z'.
   - When inserting a string with wildcards into the trie, at each wildcard position, we need to branch out to all possible 26 letters. This results in multiple paths in the trie.

3. **Efficient Trie Implementation**:
   - Given the constraints (`T` up to \(10^5\), `N` up to 25, string length up to 100), performance is critical.
   - Implementing the trie with a list of lists (children) indexed by character positions (e.g., 'A' to 'Z' mapped to 0-25) is more efficient than using dictionaries for child nodes.
   - Reusing node indices and pre-allocating space can significantly speed up the trie operations.

4. **Processing Multiple Test Cases**:
   - Since there are up to \(10^5\) test cases, it's essential to reset the trie and reuse data structures efficiently for each test case to avoid excessive memory usage and ensure quick initialization.

5. **Modulo Operation**:
   - Since the result needs to be output modulo \(998{,}244{,}353\), ensure that all counting operations account for this to prevent integer overflow and adhere to the problem's requirements.

By integrating these strategies, we can construct an efficient solution that systematically builds the trie for each test case, handles wildcards appropriately, and counts the total number of unique nodes.

        for pattern in patterns:

            while queue:
