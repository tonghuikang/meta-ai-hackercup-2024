### Key Findings

To solve the problem of counting the number of nodes in a trie formed by inserting multiple wildcard strings, we need to consider the following:

1. **Trie Structure**: Each node in the trie represents a unique prefix. The root node represents the empty string `''`.

2. **Handling Wildcards**: A wildcard `'?'` can be replaced by any uppercase Latin letter (`'A'` to `'Z'`), resulting in up to 26 possible branches at that position in the trie.

3. **Efficiency Considerations**:
   - **Constraints**: With up to \(10^5\) test cases, each potentially containing up to 25 strings of length 100, it's essential to process each test case efficiently.
   - **Per Test Case Trie**: For each test case, we build a separate trie, inserting all possible expansions of the wildcard strings. This approach ensures that memory usage remains manageable since we discard the trie after processing each test case.
   - **Optimized Traversal**: Instead of using recursive methods (which can be slow in Python for deep recursion), we use an iterative depth-first traversal with a stack to handle the insertion of strings into the trie.

4. **Counting Unique Nodes**: As we insert each possible string expansion into the trie, we incrementally count the number of new nodes created, ensuring that overlapping prefixes are only counted once.

5. **Modulo Operation**: Since the number of nodes can be large, we take the result modulo \(998{,}244{,}353\) as required.
