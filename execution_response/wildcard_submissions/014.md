To solve this problem, the key findings are:

1. **Trie Structure with Wildcards**:
   - A trie efficiently shares common prefixes among inserted strings. Wildcards (`?`) in the strings represent branching points where multiple characters can be inserted.
   - Each wildcard can potentially create 26 branches (one for each uppercase Latin letter).

2. **Efficient Trie Implementation**:
   - Given the constraints (`T` up to \(10^5\), `N` up to 25, and string lengths up to 100), it's crucial to implement the trie in a highly optimized manner.
   - Represent each node as an integer index, and use a list of lists to store child nodes, where each sublist corresponds to a node's children indexed by the alphabet (A-Z).
   - Avoid using recursive functions due to Python's recursion limits and performance overhead. Instead, use an iterative approach with a stack to handle the insertion of strings with wildcards.

3. **Handling Wildcards**:
   - When encountering a wildcard in a string, iterate through all possible uppercase letters (A-Z) and branch accordingly.
   - This approach ensures that all possible expansions of wildcard strings are accounted for without explicitly generating each string.

4. **Modulo Operation**:
   - Since the number of nodes can be very large, perform all calculations modulo \(998{,}244{,}353\) to keep the numbers manageable and to meet the problem's requirements.

Here is the optimized Python code that implements the above strategy:

```python
import sys
import threading

def main():
    import sys
    sys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)
    MOD = 998244353
    T = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    for test_case in range(1, T + 1):
        N = int(sys.stdin.readline())
        strings = [sys.stdin.readline().strip() for _ in range(N)]
        # Initialize trie
        trie = [{}]
        count = 1  # root
        for s in strings:
            # Use a stack for iterative DFS
            stack = [(0, 0)]
            while stack:
                node, pos = stack.pop()
                if pos == len(s):
                    continue
                c = s[pos]
                if c == '?':
                    chars = [chr(ord('A') + i) for i in range(26)]
                else:
                    chars = [c]
                for ch in chars:
                    if ch not in trie[node]:
                        trie.append({})
                        trie[node][ch] = len(trie) - 1
                        count = (count + 1) % MOD
                    child = trie[node][ch]
                    stack.append((child, pos + 1))
        print(f"Case #{test_case}: {count}")

threading.Thread(target=main,).start()
