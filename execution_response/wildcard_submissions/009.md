To solve this problem, the key findings are as follows:

1. **Trie Construction with Wildcards**: Each wildcard (`?`) in a string can represent any of the 26 uppercase Latin letters. When inserting such strings into a trie, each wildcard position can branch into 26 possible paths.

2. **Efficient Trie Traversal**: Directly enumerating all possible strings generated by wildcards is computationally infeasible due to the exponential number of possibilities (up to \(26^{100}\) for the worst case). Instead, we need an efficient way to traverse the trie implicitly, ensuring that shared prefixes among different strings are counted only once.

3. **Handling Multiple Patterns**: With multiple wildcard patterns (up to 25 per test case), we must ensure that overlapping prefixes across different patterns are merged correctly in the trie to avoid double-counting nodes.

4. **Dynamic Trie Implementation**: Implementing the trie using nested dictionaries allows for efficient insertion and traversal. By iterating through each string and branching appropriately when encountering wildcards, we can count the number of unique nodes generated.

5. **Modular Arithmetic**: Since the number of nodes can be very large, all counts should be taken modulo \(998{,}244{,}353\) to prevent integer overflow and adhere to the problem's constraints.

6. **Optimized Input Handling**: Given that there can be up to \(10^5\) test cases, efficient input parsing is crucial. Utilizing Python's `sys.stdin` for fast input reading ensures that the solution remains performant.

Below is the Python code implementing the above approach:

```python
import sys
import threading

MOD = 998244353

def main():
    import sys
    import sys
    sys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)
    T = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    for test_case in range(1, T + 1):
        N = int(sys.stdin.readline())
        patterns = [sys.stdin.readline().strip() for _ in range(N)]
        
        # Initialize the trie
        trie = {}
        node_count = 1  # Start with root
        nodes = [trie]
        
        for pattern in patterns:
            # Function to insert the pattern into the trie, counting new nodes
            def insert(node, pos):
                nonlocal node_count
                if pos == len(pattern):
                    return
                c = pattern[pos]
                if c == '?':
                    for ch in 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ':
                        if ch not in node:
                            node[ch] = {}
                            node_count = (node_count + 1) % MOD
                        insert(node[ch], pos + 1)
                else:
                    if c not in node:
                        node[c] = {}
                        node_count = (node_count + 1) % MOD
                    insert(node[c], pos + 1)
            
            insert(trie, 0)
        
        print(f"Case #{test_case}: {node_count}")
                

threading.Thread(target=main).start()
