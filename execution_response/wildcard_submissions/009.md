**Key Findings:**

1. **Trie Structure:** Each node in the trie represents a unique prefix. The root node corresponds to the empty string `''`. When inserting strings with wildcards (`?`), each wildcard can branch into any of the 26 uppercase Latin letters.

2. **Handling Wildcards:** For each string with wildcards, during insertion into the trie, every possible replacement of `?` with a letter needs to be considered. This can lead to multiple branches in the trie.

3. **Efficiency Considerations:** Given the constraints (up to \(10^5\) test cases, each with up to 25 strings of length 100), it's crucial to optimize the trie insertion process. This involves reusing nodes where possible and avoiding redundant computations.

4. **Modulo Operation:** Since the number of nodes can be very large, all counts should be computed modulo \(998{,}244{,}353\) to prevent integer overflow and manage large numbers efficiently.

5. **Optimized Trie Implementation:** Use a nested dictionary structure for the trie nodes to allow for fast insertions and lookups. By iterating through each character of the strings and handling wildcards appropriately, we can efficiently count the unique nodes created in the trie.

**Python Code:**

    sys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)
    T = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    for case in range(1, T + 1):
        N = int(sys.stdin.readline())
        strings = [sys.stdin.readline().strip() for _ in range(N)]
        
        trie = {}
        node_count = 1  # Start with root node
        
        for s in strings:
            stack = [(trie, 0)]
            # Use a list of tuples: (current_node, position in string)
            # Since we have wildcards, we need to keep track of multiple paths
            # We'll use BFS to avoid stack overflow
            queue = [(trie, 0)]
            while queue:
                current_node, pos = queue.pop()
                if pos == len(s):
                    continue
                char = s[pos]

                            node_count = (node_count + 1) % MOD
                        queue.append((current_node[c], pos + 1))
                else:
