**Key Findings:**

1. **Trie Structure and Prefixes**: A trie efficiently represents all unique prefixes of inserted strings. The total number of nodes in the trie corresponds to the number of unique prefixes across all inserted strings, including the root node for the empty string.

2. **Handling Wildcards**: Each wildcard `'?'` in a string can represent any of the 26 uppercase letters. Directly expanding all possibilities is computationally infeasible due to exponential growth (e.g., a string with 100 wildcards would represent \(26^{100}\) strings). Instead, we must handle wildcards implicitly during trie construction.

3. **Efficient Trie Construction**: To manage multiple wildcard strings without explicitly expanding them:
   - **Shared Prefixes**: Utilize the trieâ€™s ability to share common prefixes among different strings to avoid redundant computations.
   - **Recursive Insertion with Branching**: When encountering a wildcard, branch into all 26 possible paths recursively, ensuring that common paths are merged.
   - **Memoization**: Implement memoization to cache and reuse computations for similar subtree structures, significantly reducing the number of operations.

4. **Per Test Case Isolation**: Each test case is independent, requiring a separate trie. Efficient memory management and resetting structures between test cases are crucial to handle up to \(10^5\) test cases within time constraints.

5. **Modular Arithmetic**: Since the number of nodes can be very large, all counts are computed modulo \(998{,}244{,}353\) to prevent integer overflow and ensure manageable number sizes.

6. **Optimization Considerations**:
   - **Fast Character Handling**: Represent characters as indices (0-25) to facilitate quick access and comparison.
   - **Iterative Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Use an iterative approach with a stack to prevent stack overflow issues that can arise with deep recursion (e.g., strings of length 100).
   - **Memory Efficiency**: Use lightweight data structures for trie nodes (such as lists of children) to minimize memory usage, especially important when dealing with a large number of test cases.

7. **Edge Cases and Constraints**: Ensure proper handling of edge cases, such as empty strings or strings composed entirely of wildcards, and adhere strictly to the problem constraints to avoid incorrect calculations.

By leveraging these insights, we can construct an efficient solution that calculates the number of unique trie nodes for each test case without explicitly generating all possible string expansions.
