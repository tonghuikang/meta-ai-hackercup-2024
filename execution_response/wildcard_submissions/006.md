**Key Findings:**

To solve the problem of counting the number of nodes in a trie after inserting multiple wildcard strings, consider the following points:

1. **Trie Structure:** A trie is a tree-like data structure where each node represents a prefix of some inserted string. Each edge corresponds to a character from 'A' to 'Z'.

2. **Handling Wildcards:** When encountering a wildcard character '?', it represents any of the 26 uppercase English letters. This means that for a single wildcard, the trie branches out into 26 possible paths.

3. **Counting Unique Prefixes:** The total number of nodes in the trie corresponds to the number of unique prefixes across all possible strings generated by replacing wildcards in the input strings.

4. **Efficient Trie Implementation:** To manage the potentially large number of nodes (especially with wildcards), use an array-based trie where each node is represented as a list of 26 integers (for each letter 'A' to 'Z'). This allows for constant-time access and updates.

5. **Per-Test-Case Trie Reset:** Since each test case is independent, initialize a new trie for each test case to ensure that the node counts do not overlap between different test cases.

6. **Optimizing for Multiple Test Cases:** Given that there can be up to \(10^5\) test cases, it's crucial to handle input efficiently by reading all data at once and processing it sequentially.

**Python Code:**

    sys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)
    MOD = 998244353
    data = sys.stdin.read().split()
    idx = 0
    T = int(data[idx])
    idx +=1
    for test_case in range(1, T+1):
        N = int(data[idx])
        idx +=1
        patterns = data[idx:idx+N]
        idx +=N
        # Initialize trie
        nodes = [[-1]*26]
        node_count = 1
        stack = []
        for pattern in patterns:
            stack = [(0, 0)]
            while stack:
                node, pos = stack.pop()
                if pos == len(pattern):
                    continue
                c = pattern[pos]
                if c == '?':
                    for ci in range(26):
                        if nodes[node][ci] == -1:
                            nodes[node][ci] = node_count
                            nodes.append([-1]*26)
                            node_count +=1
                        stack.append((nodes[node][ci], pos +1))
                else:
                    ci = ord(c) - ord('A')
                    if nodes[node][ci] == -1:
                        nodes[node][ci] = node_count
                        nodes.append([-1]*26)
                        node_count +=1
                    stack.append((nodes[node][ci], pos +1))
        print(f"Case #{test_case}: {node_count % MOD}")
