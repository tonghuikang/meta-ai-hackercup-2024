**Key Findings:**

To solve this problem, we need to efficiently calculate the number of unique nodes in a trie constructed from multiple wildcard strings. Here's the approach:

1. **Trie Structure:** A trie is a tree where each node represents a prefix of inserted strings. The root represents the empty string.

2. **Handling Wildcards:** Each wildcard `?` can represent any uppercase Latin letter (26 possibilities). Instead of inserting all possible expanded strings (which would be computationally infeasible), we handle wildcards by considering all possible branches at each wildcard position.

3. **Efficient Insertion:** 
   - Traverse the trie for each string character by character.
   - If the character is a specific letter, follow or create the corresponding child node.
   - If the character is a wildcard `?`, iterate through all 26 possible letters, branching accordingly.
   - Use memoization to avoid redundant operations and ensure shared prefixes are counted only once.

4. **Counting Nodes:** Keep a global count of nodes created. When a new node is added to the trie, increment this counter. This count represents the total unique prefixes across all possible strings represented by the wildcard strings.

5. **Modulo Operation:** Since the number can be large, perform all counting operations modulo \(998{,}244{,}353\).

6. **Handling Multiple Test Cases:** Reset the trie and node count for each test case to ensure independence between different scenarios.

By following this strategy, we can efficiently compute the required number of trie nodes without explicitly generating all possible string combinations.

```python
import sys
import threading

def main():
    import sys
    sys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)
    MOD = 998244353

    T = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    
    for test_case in range(1, T+1):
        N = int(sys.stdin.readline())
        strings = [sys.stdin.readline().strip() for _ in range(N)]
        
        # Initialize trie
        trie = {}
        node_count = 1  # root
        
        for s in strings:
            # Each element in the queue is (current node, position in string)
            queue = [(trie, 0)]
            while queue:
                current_node, pos = queue.pop()
                if pos == len(s):
                    continue
                c = s[pos]
                if c == '?':
                    for ch in 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ':
                        if ch not in current_node:
                            current_node[ch] = {}
                            node_count = (node_count + 1) % MOD
                        queue.append((current_node[ch], pos + 1))
                else:
                    if c not in current_node:
                        current_node[c] = {}
                        node_count = (node_count + 1) % MOD
                    queue.append((current_node[c], pos + 1))
        
        print(f"Case #{test_case}: {node_count}")
