To solve this problem, we need to compute the total number of unique nodes in a trie built from all possible strings formed by the given wildcard strings. Each wildcard string represents multiple actual strings (by replacing the '?' with uppercase letters), leading to a massive number of possible strings and prefixes if we try to enumerate them all directly.

**Key Findings:**

1. **Direct Enumeration is Infeasible:** Due to large possible combinations (especially when wildcard positions are many), directly generating all possible strings or all prefixes is computationally infeasible.

2. **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle:** To avoid overcounting overlapping prefixes from different strings, we use the inclusion-exclusion principle. This allows us to compute the total number of unique prefixes (nodes) by summing the counts from individual strings and then subtracting the overlaps.

3. **Computing Prefix Counts per String:** 
   - For each string, compute the total number of prefixes it can generate.
   - The number of prefixes of length `k` is the product of the possible characters at each position up to `k`.

4. **Computing Overlaps Between Strings:**
   - For each pair of strings, compute the number of overlapping prefixes they share.
   - Extend this to triplets, quadruplets, etc., as necessary within computational limits.

5. **Feasibility with Constraints:**
   - Given that the maximum `N` is 25, the number of pairs is manageable (`C(25,2) = 300`).
   - Similarly, the number of triplets (`C(25,3) = 2300`) is acceptable.
   - We proceed up to quadruplets if time permits.

6. **Implementation Steps:**
   - Compute per-string prefix counts (`Pi`).
   - Compute overlaps between pairs (`Pij`), triplets (`Pijk`), etc.
   - Use the inclusion-exclusion principle to compute the total number of nodes:
     ```
     Total Nodes = Sum(Pi) - Sum(Pij) + Sum(Pijk) - Sum(Pijkl) + ...
     ```

7. **Handling Large Numbers:**
   - Since the counts can be very large, modulo operations are performed at each step to keep numbers within bounds.

Now, here's the Python code implementing this logic:

**Explanation of the Code:**

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - Read the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, read `N` and the list of strings `S`.
   - Initialize variables, including the `MOD` value and the recursion limit.

2. **Processing Each String:**
   - For each string, create a list of possible characters at each position.
   - If the character is '?', the possible characters are all uppercase letters.
   - Store these in a list `C_i`.

3. **Computing per-string Prefix Counts (`Pi`):**
   - For each string, compute the total number of prefixes it can generate.
   - Use modular multiplication to keep numbers within bounds.

4. **Computing Overlaps Between Pairs (`Pij`):**
   - For each pair of strings, compute the number of overlapping prefixes.
   - The overlap at each position is the intersection of possible characters at that position in both strings.
   - Break early if the intersection is empty (no further overlaps possible).

5. **Computing Overlaps for Triplets (`Pijk`) and Quadruplets (`Pijkl`):**
   - Similarly compute overlapping prefixes for triplets and quadruplets.
   - Use loops over combinations of strings.

6. **Applying Inclusion-Exclusion Principle:**
   - Compute the total number of nodes by summing the per-string counts.
   - Subtract the counts of overlapping prefixes between pairs.
   - Add back the counts of overlapping prefixes among triplets.
   - Subtract the counts for quadruplets.
   - Continue as necessary.

7. **Output:**
   - Print the result in the required format.

**Note:** In practice, depending on time constraints and actual values of `N`, you might need to adjust the depth of inclusion-exclusion (e.g., not proceeding to quadruplets if it's not computationally feasible). However, for `N` up to 25, as specified in the problem, this code should perform adequately.
