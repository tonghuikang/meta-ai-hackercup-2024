To solve the problem, we need to compute the total number of unique nodes in a trie formed by all possible strings generated from given wildcard strings. Each wildcard string `S_i` can represent many strings due to the presence of '?' characters, which can be replaced by any uppercase letter from 'A' to 'Z'.

**Key Findings:**

1. **Trie of Patterns:**
   - We can build a trie (prefix tree) of the given wildcard patterns (`S_i`) without expanding the wildcards. This trie will contain nodes up to `N * L`, where `N` is the number of strings and `L` is the maximum length of the strings.

2. **Recursively Expanding Wildcards:**
   - We need to traverse this trie and, at each node, compute the total number of nodes in the expanded trie (after replacing '?' with all possible letters).
   - At each node, we consider the possible letters that can occur based on the wildcard positions in the `S_i` strings that pass through this node.

3. **Memoization and Caching:**
   - To avoid recomputation and to ensure efficient traversal, we use memoization. We cache the total number of nodes in the subtree rooted at each node.
   - This is essential because multiple paths in the trie can lead to the same node due to overlapping patterns.

4. **Handling Wildcards:**
   - When a node corresponds to a '?' in any `S_i`, we consider all uppercase letters 'A' to 'Z' as possible expansions.
   - For each possible letter, we create or move to a child node, ensuring we cover all possible substitutions of the wildcard.

5. **Total Node Calculation:**
   - The total number of nodes is calculated as `1` (for the current node) plus the sum of the total nodes in all its child subtrees.
   - This recursive computation accumulates the total number of unique nodes in the trie.

6. **Avoiding Overcounting:**
   - By building the trie considering the positions of the wildcards and letters in each string and sharing common prefixes, we avoid counting duplicate prefixes that would arise from different `S_i` strings.

7. **Manageable Node Count:**
   - Since `N` is up to 25 and the maximum length of strings is 100, the total number of nodes in the pattern trie (before expansion) is manageable (up to 2,500).
   - Even after expanding the wildcards, the total number of nodes remains within acceptable limits (approximately 65,000 nodes), allowing for efficient processing.

**Python Code:**

```python
T = int(input())
for case_num in range(1, T + 1):
    N = int(input())
    S_list = [input() for _ in range(N)]

    # Build the pattern trie
    class Node:
        def __init__(self):
            self.children = {}
            self.indices = []  # List of tuples (S_i_index, position in S_i)
            self.dp = None  # Memoization for the total number of nodes

    root = Node()
    for idx, S in enumerate(S_list):
        node = root
        node.indices.append((idx, 0))  # (string index, position)
        for pos in range(len(S)):
            c = S[pos]
            if c not in node.children:
                node.children[c] = Node()
            node = node.children[c]
            node.indices.append((idx, pos + 1))  # Next position in S_i

            c = S[pos]
            if c == '?':
                letters.update(chr(ord('A') + i) for i in range(26))
            else:
                letters.add(c)
        # For each possible letter, proceed to child node
        for c in letters:
            if c in node.children:

            else:

                child = Node()
                node.children[c] = child
                # Update indices for the new child node
                for idx, pos in node.indices:

                    if pos == len(S):

                    if S[pos] == c or S[pos] == '?':

        node.dp = total
        return total

    result = dfs(root)
