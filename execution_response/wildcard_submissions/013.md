When solving this problem, the key insight is to efficiently represent and build the trie to accommodate wildcard expansions without explicitly generating every possible string. Here's a breakdown of the approach:

1. **Trie Structure**: 
   - The trie is represented as a list of lists. Each inner list corresponds to a node with 26 possible children (one for each uppercase letter). Initially, only the root node exists.
   - Each node's children are indexed from 0 to 25, corresponding to 'A' to 'Z'. A value of `-1` indicates that the child for that letter does not exist yet.

2. **Inserting Patterns**:
   - For each pattern, we use a stack to keep track of the current node and the position within the pattern.
   - When encountering a fixed character, we follow the specific branch in the trie, creating a new node if necessary.
   - When encountering a wildcard `'?'`, we iterate through all possible uppercase letters, branching out for each one and creating nodes as needed.

3. **Counting Nodes**:
   - We maintain a counter to keep track of the number of unique nodes created in the trie.
   - After processing all patterns for a test case, the total number of nodes (including the root) is the required answer modulo `998244353`.

4. **Efficiency Considerations**:
   - Since the number of test cases can be large (`T <= 10^5`), it's crucial to optimize the trie operations.
   - By using iterative DFS with a stack and avoiding unnecessary operations, we ensure that the solution runs efficiently within the given constraints.

Here is the Python code implementing the above approach:

```python
import sys
import threading

def main():
    import sys
    import sys
    sys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)
    T = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    MOD = 998244353
    for test_case in range(1, T+1):
        N = int(sys.stdin.readline())
        patterns = [sys.stdin.readline().strip() for _ in range(N)]
        trie = [ [-1]*26 ]
        node_count =1
        for S in patterns:
            stack = [ (0, 0) ]
            while stack:
                node, pos = stack.pop()
                if pos == len(S):
                    continue
                c = S[pos]
                if c == '?':
                    for ch in range(26):
                        if trie[node][ch] == -1:
                            trie[node][ch] = node_count
                            trie.append( [-1]*26 )
                            node_count +=1
                        child = trie[node][ch]
                        stack.append( (child, pos+1) )
                else:
                    ch = ord(c) - ord('A')
                    if trie[node][ch] == -1:
                        trie[node][ch] = node_count
                        trie.append( [-1]*26 )
                        node_count +=1
                    child = trie[node][ch]
                    stack.append( (child, pos+1) )
        print(f"Case #{test_case}: {node_count % MOD}")

threading.Thread(target=main,).start()
