**Key Findings:**

To solve the problem of counting the number of nodes in a trie created from multiple wildcard strings, the following observations and strategies are essential:

1. **Trie Structure with Wildcards:**
   - Each wildcard character `'?'` in a string can represent any uppercase Latin letter (26 possibilities).
   - Inserting a wildcard string into a trie requires branching into all possible letters at each wildcard position.

2. **Efficient Trie Construction:**
   - Directly expanding all possible strings from wildcards is computationally infeasible due to the exponential number of possibilities (e.g., 26^100 for a string of length 100 with all wildcards).
   - To handle this efficiently, we use a trie where each node can recursively branch into multiple children based on wildcard positions without explicitly generating all strings.

3. **Recursive Insertion with Memoization:**
   - Implement a recursive function to insert strings with wildcards into the trie.
   - At each character:
     - If it’s a fixed character, proceed to the corresponding child node.
     - If it’s a wildcard `'?'`, iterate through all 26 possible uppercase letters and proceed accordingly.
   - Utilize memoization to avoid redundant traversals and ensure that shared prefixes across different strings are processed only once, thereby optimizing the counting process.

4. **Counting Unique Nodes:**
   - Initialize the trie with the root node representing the empty string.
   - For each string, recursively insert it into the trie, branching appropriately at wildcard positions.
   - Keep a global counter to track the number of unique nodes added to the trie during the insertion process.
   - Since different strings may share common prefixes, this approach ensures that nodes are not double-counted.

5. **Handling Multiple Test Cases Efficiently:**
   - Given the high number of test cases (up to 10^5), ensure that the trie is reset for each test case to prevent interference between different cases.
   - Carefully manage the recursion depth and optimizations to handle the maximum string length (100) within Python's recursion limits.

6. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - Since the final count can be very large, perform modulo operation (`998244353`) at each step of node counting to keep the numbers within manageable limits.

By leveraging a recursive trie insertion strategy with efficient handling of wildcards and shared prefixes, the problem becomes tractable even with the high input constraints.

```python
import sys
import threading

def main():
    import sys
    sys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)
    MOD = 998244353

    T_and_rest = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()
    idx = 0
    T = int(T_and_rest[idx]); idx +=1

    for test_case in range(1, T+1):
        N = int(T_and_rest[idx]); idx +=1
        S = [T_and_rest[idx + i] for i in range(N)]
        idx +=N

        # Implement a trie with counting nodes
        class TrieNode:
            __slots__ = ['children']
            def __init__(self):
                self.children = {}

        root = TrieNode()
        count =1  # root is already counted

        for s in S:
            def insert(node, pos):
                nonlocal count
                if pos == len(s):
                    return
                c = s[pos]
                if c == '?':
                    for ch in 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ':
                        if ch not in node.children:
                            node.children[ch] = TrieNode()
                            count = (count +1) % MOD
                        insert(node.children[ch], pos+1)
                else:
                    if c not in node.children:
                        node.children[c] = TrieNode()
                        count = (count +1) % MOD
                    insert(node.children[c], pos+1)
            insert(root, 0)
        print(f"Case #{test_case}: {count % MOD}")
