**Key Findings:**

To solve the problem of counting the number of nodes in a trie formed by multiple wildcard strings, we can follow these steps:

1. **Trie Structure:** 
   - A trie is initialized with a root node representing the empty string.
   - Each node can have up to 26 children (one for each uppercase Latin letter).

2. **Handling Wildcards:**
   - When inserting a string with wildcards (`?`), each `?` can represent any of the 26 uppercase letters.
   - Instead of generating all possible strings (which is computationally expensive), we traverse the trie:
     - For each character in the string:
       - If it's a fixed letter, follow or create the corresponding child node.
       - If it's a `?`, iterate through all possible 26 children, following or creating nodes as needed.

3. **Counting Nodes:**
   - We maintain a counter for the number of unique nodes added to the trie.
   - For each test case, we reset the trie and the counter.
   - After inserting all strings for a test case, the counter reflects the total number of nodes in the trie.

4. **Efficiency Considerations:**
   - Given the high number of test cases (`T â‰¤ 10^5`), it's crucial to implement the trie efficiently.
   - Using lists to represent child nodes (with indices corresponding to letters) allows for faster access and modification.
   - Precomputing the index for each uppercase letter (`'A'` to `'Z'`) optimizes the lookup process.

5. **Modulo Operation:**
   - Since the number of nodes can be large, all counts are taken modulo `998244353` as required.

The following Python code implements this approach efficiently:

```python
import sys
import threading

def main():
    import sys
    import math
    sys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)
    T = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    MOD = 998244353
    for case in range(1, T + 1):
        N = int(sys.stdin.readline())
        strings = [sys.stdin.readline().strip() for _ in range(N)]
        trie = [{}]
        node_count = 1
        for s in strings:
            current_nodes = [0]
            for c in s:
                next_nodes = []
                if c == '?':
                    letters = list(range(26))
                else:
                    letters = [ord(c) - 65]
                for node in current_nodes:
                    for l in letters:
                        if l not in trie[node]:
                            trie.append({})
                            trie[node][l] = node_count
                            node_count += 1
                        next_nodes.append(trie[node][l])
                current_nodes = next_nodes
            # No need to mark end of string
        print(f"Case #{case}: {node_count % MOD}")

threading.Thread(target=main).start()
```
