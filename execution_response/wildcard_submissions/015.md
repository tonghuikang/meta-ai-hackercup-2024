When solving this problem, the key findings are:

1. **Trie Representation**: A trie can be efficiently represented using recursive traversal, where each node corresponds to a prefix of some string. The goal is to count all unique prefixes across all possible strings generated from the wildcard strings.

2. **Handling Wildcards**: For each position in the strings, determine the set of possible characters. If any string has a wildcard (`?`) at a position, it implies that all 26 uppercase letters are possible for that position.

3. **State Representation**: Use bitmasking to represent the active set of strings that contribute to the current node in the trie. This allows efficient memoization and reduces redundant computations.

4. **Memoization**: To avoid recalculating the number of nodes for the same state multiple times, utilize memoization. Given that the number of possible states is manageable (especially since \( N \leq 25 \)), this ensures that each state is processed only once.

5. **Recursive Counting**: Start from the root node and recursively count the number of unique prefixes by considering all possible character choices at each position, updating the active set of strings accordingly.

6. **Modular Arithmetic**: Since the number of nodes can be very large, perform all calculations modulo \( 998244353 \) to keep the numbers within manageable limits.

Here is the Python code that implements the above approach:

```python
import sys
import threading

def main():
    import sys
    sys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)
    MOD = 998244353

    T = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    for test_case in range(1, T +1):
        N = int(sys.stdin.readline())
        S = [sys.stdin.readline().strip() for _ in range(N)]
        # Precompute the possible characters for each string at each position
        max_len = max(len(s) for s in S) if S else 0
        # For each string, pad it to max_len with None
        # Precompute for each string, list of possible characters at each position
        possible = []
        for s in S:
            chars = []
            for c in s:
                if c == '?':
                    chars.append(None)  # Represents any uppercase letter
                else:
                    chars.append(c)
            # Pad with None for positions beyond the string's length
            # Not necessary since we only consider up to their length
            possible.append(chars)
        from collections import defaultdict

        from functools import lru_cache

        # To represent state, we need a tuple of indices for each string
        # But it's better to represent as a bitmask of active strings
        # Also, track the position for each string
        # But all strings start at position 0

        # Instead, define state as a bitmask of which strings are active (not yet ended)
        # and their current position is depth
        # At each depth, determine for active strings, what possible characters they have

        # Precompute for each string, for each position, the possible characters
        # If position >= len(s), the string does not contribute

        # For memoization, use a dictionary
        from collections import deque

            memo = {}

                    return memo[active]

                # Collect all possible characters from active strings at current depth
                # First, find for each active string, the possible characters at current depth
                # Since we are traversing depth first, we need to track the current depth
                # Hence, pass depth as an argument
                # But instead, since all strings advance synchronously, track depth implicitly
                # To have current depth, we need to track how many steps we've taken
                # Alternative Idea: Pass the current depth along with active
                # To simplify, include depth in the state
                # But better to handle recursively with depth as a separate parameter
                # So redefine the function with depth
