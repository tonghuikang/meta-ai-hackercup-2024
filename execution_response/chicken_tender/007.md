**Key Findings:**

To determine whether the chicken tender (a convex polygon) can fit into the sauce cup under the given conditions, we need to consider the following steps:

1. **Rotation:** 
   - For each vertex of the polygon, rotate the entire polygon such that this vertex lies on the x-axis. This ensures that the rotated polygon has at least one vertex on the bottom of the sauce cup.
   
2. **Translation:** 
   - After rotation, translate the polygon horizontally so that the rotated vertex lies within the width `[0, W]` of the sauce cup.
   
3. **Validation of Conditions:**
   - **All Vertices Above X-axis:** Ensure that all vertices of the rotated and translated polygon lie on or above the x-axis.
   - **Vertex on Sauce Cup Bottom:** Confirm that the rotated vertex lies on the x-axis within the sauce cup's width `[0, W]`.
   - **Interior Point Within Sauce Cup:** Check that at least one point of the polygon (not necessarily a vertex) lies strictly within the interior of the sauce cup `(0 < x < W, 0 < y < D)`.
   - **No Sauce Cup Points Inside Polygon:** Ensure that no point on the boundary of the sauce cup lies strictly inside the polygon.
   
4. **Geometric Computations:**
   - Implement geometric functions to handle rotation, translation, and point-in-polygon checks, especially for convex polygons, which simplifies some of these computations.
   
5. **Iterative Verification:**
   - Iterate through each vertex, perform the rotation and translation, and verify all conditions. If any configuration satisfies all conditions, the answer is `Yes`; otherwise, `No`.

Given the constraints (`N <= 20`, `T <= 30`), this approach is computationally feasible.
