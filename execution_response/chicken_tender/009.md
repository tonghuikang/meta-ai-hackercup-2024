### Key Findings

To determine whether a convex polygon (representing a chicken tender) can be rotated and translated to fit into a BBQ sauce cup, we can follow these steps:

1. **Rotation Alignment:** 
   - Iterate through each vertex of the polygon.
   - For each vertex, calculate the rotation angle required to align that vertex with the x-axis. This ensures the vertex lies on or above the x-axis after rotation.

2. **Translation Within Bounds:**
   - After rotation, translate the polygon horizontally so that the rotated vertex lies within the width `W` of the sauce cup (i.e., between `x=0` and `x=W`).
   - Vertically translate the polygon upwards if necessary to ensure all vertices are on or above the x-axis.

3. **Intersection Checks:**
   - **Presence Within the Cup:** Verify that at least one point of the polygon lies strictly within the interior of the sauce cup. This ensures that the tender reaches into the cup.
   - **No Enclosure of Cup Boundaries:** Ensure that no point on the boundary of the sauce cup lies strictly within the interior of the polygon. This prevents the tender from obstructing the sauce cup.

4. **Geometric Computations:**
   - Utilize the `shapely` library for precise geometric operations such as rotation, translation, and intersection checks. This simplifies handling convex polygons and performing the necessary geometric validations.

5. **Optimization:**
   - Given the constraints (`N ≤ 20`), it's feasible to check each vertex for alignment without significant computational overhead.
   - For each rotated and translated position, perform the necessary geometric checks to determine if it satisfies all conditions.

By systematically rotating and translating the polygon while performing geometric validations, we can ascertain whether the chicken tender can fit appropriately into the sauce cup.
