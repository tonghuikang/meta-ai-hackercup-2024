**Key Findings:**

To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given convex polygon (representing a chicken tender) can be rotated and translated to fit into a rectangular sauce cup while satisfying specific constraints. Here's a breakdown of the approach:

1. **Rotation and Alignment:**
   - Iterate through each edge of the polygon.
   - Rotate the polygon such that the selected edge aligns with the x-axis.
   
2. **Translation:**
   - After rotation, translate the polygon so that one of its vertices lies on the x-axis within the range `[0, W]`.
   
3. **Constraint Verification:**
   - **All vertices must lie on or above the x-axis.**
   - **At least one vertex must lie on the x-axis within `[0, W]`.**
   - **There must be at least one point inside the polygon that lies strictly within the bounds of the sauce cup `(0 < x < W, 0 < y < D)`.**
   - **No point on the boundary of the sauce cup should lie strictly inside the polygon.**
   
4. **Point-in-Polygon Test:**
   - Implement the ray-casting algorithm to check if specific points lie inside the polygon.
   - For efficiency, sample key points such as the center of the sauce cup and points on its boundaries.
   
5. **Edge Cases and Precision:**
   - Handle cases where multiple vertices lie on the x-axis.
   - Ensure floating-point precision is maintained to avoid geometric inaccuracies.

By systematically rotating, translating, and verifying these constraints for each polygon, we can determine whether it can fit into the sauce cup as required.
