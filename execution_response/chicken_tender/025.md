**Key Findings:**

1. **Rotation Strategy:**
   - Since we need at least one vertex of the polygon to lie on the x-axis within the range \([0, W]\), we iterate through each vertex and compute the rotation required to place that vertex on the x-axis.
   
2. **Translation After Rotation:**
   - After rotating the polygon so that a specific vertex lies on the x-axis, we translate the polygon vertically to ensure that the rotated vertex is exactly on the x-axis (\(y = 0\)).
   - We then determine the feasible range of horizontal (x-axis) translations such that the rotated vertex lies within \([0, W]\).

3. **Validation Checks:**
   - **All Vertices Above X-Axis:** Ensure that after rotation and translation, all vertices of the polygon have \(y \geq 0\).
   - **Point Inside Sauce Cup:** Check if there's at least one point of the polygon strictly inside the sauce cup (\(0 < x < W\) and \(0 < y < D\)).
   - **No Boundary Point Inside Polygon:** Ensure that no point on the boundaries of the sauce cup is strictly inside the polygon.

4. **Geometric Operations:**
   - Utilize geometric transformations (rotation and translation) and computational geometry techniques such as the Separating Axis Theorem (SAT) to check for point containment and polygon intersections.

5. **Efficiency Consideration:**
   - Given the constraints (\(N \leq 20\) and \(T \leq 30\)), iterating through each vertex and performing the necessary transformations and checks is computationally feasible.
