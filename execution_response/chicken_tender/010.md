**Key Findings:**

To determine whether a convex polygon (representing a chicken tender) can be rotated and translated to fit into a rectangular sauce cup while satisfying the given constraints, the following approach is taken:

1. **Rotation Alignment:**
   - For each vertex of the polygon, calculate the angle needed to rotate the polygon such that this vertex lies on the x-axis.
   - Apply this rotation to the entire polygon.

2. **Translation:**
   - After rotation, translate the polygon horizontally so that the rotated vertex lies within the width `(0 <= x <= W)` of the sauce cup.
   - Multiple translations are considered by aligning the vertex to the left edge (`x=0`), right edge (`x=W`), and the center (`x=W/2`) of the sauce cup.

3. **Constraint Checks:**
   - **Y-Coordinate Constraint:** Ensure that after rotation and translation, all vertices of the polygon have `y >= 0`.
   - **Internal Point Constraint:** Verify that at least one vertex of the polygon lies strictly inside the sauce cup `(0 < x < W and 0 < y < D)`.
   - **Boundary Overlap Constraint:** Ensure that no point on the boundary of the sauce cup lies strictly inside the polygon. This is approximated by sampling multiple points along each boundary edge of the sauce cup and checking their inclusion within the polygon.

4. **Point-In-Polygon Check:**
   - A ray-casting algorithm is implemented to determine whether a point lies inside a convex polygon. For convex polygons, this is optimized by ensuring that all cross-products of edge vectors with the point vector have the same sign.

5. **Final Decision:**
   - If any rotation and translation combination satisfies all the constraints, the answer is `Yes`. Otherwise, it's `No`.

The algorithm iterates through all possible vertex alignments and translations, efficiently checking the necessary geometric conditions to ensure the polygon fits appropriately within the sauce cup.
