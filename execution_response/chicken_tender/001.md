To solve this problem, we need to determine if it's possible to rotate and translate a given convex polygon (representing a chicken tender) so that it fits into the bottom of a sauce cup (represented by a rectangle) following the constraints:

1. All vertices of the polygon lie on or above the x-axis.
2. Some vertex of the polygon lies on the x-axis between x=0 and x=W (inclusive).
3. Some point of the polygon lies strictly within the bounds of the sauce cup.
4. No point on the sauce cup lies strictly within the bounds of the polygon.

Given the constraints `N ≤ 20` and `T ≤ 30`, we can afford an O(N^2) solution, where N is the number of vertices in the polygon.

Here's the approach:

1. **Generate Possible Rotations**: 
   - For every pair of vertices in the polygon, calculate the angle required to make the line connecting them horizontal. This gives us O(N^2) possible angles to rotate the polygon.
   - For each angle θ, rotate the polygon accordingly.

2. **Translate Vertically**:
   - After rotation, adjust the polygon vertically so that the lowest y-coordinate (`ymin`) of the polygon is at 0. This ensures all vertices have y ≥ 0.

3. **Find Potential Horizontal Translations**:
   - Identify all vertices at y=0 after rotation and vertical translation.
   - For each such vertex, consider all horizontal translations (x-offsets) that would place this vertex at x ∈ [0, W].

4. **Check Feasibility**:
   - For each x-offset, apply it to the polygon.
   - Check if the polygon intersects the sauce cup rectangle (not just touching the edges).
   - Ensure that none of the sauce cup's corner points ((0,0), (0,D), (W,0), (W,D)) are strictly inside the polygon (they can be on the edge).

5. **Conclusion**:
   - If any x-offset results in the polygon meeting the conditions, output `Yes`.
   - If none of the rotations and translations meet the conditions, output `No`.

We use the `shapely` library for geometric operations like rotation, translation, and intersection testing.

**Key Findings:**

- We can generate all possible angles by considering lines formed by all pairs of vertices.
- For each angle, we can attempt to rotate and translate the polygon to satisfy the problem's constraints.
- By efficiently checking the rotated and translated polygons against the sauce cup (using geometric operations), we can determine if the tender can reach the bottom of the sauce cup.
- The problem can be solved within the time constraints by leveraging efficient geometric computation libraries like `shapely`.
