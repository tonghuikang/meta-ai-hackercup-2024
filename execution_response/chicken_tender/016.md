**Key Findings:**

To solve the problem of determining whether a convex polygon (chicken tender) can be rotated and translated to fit within a rectangular sauce cup, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understanding Constraints:**
   - The polygon must lie entirely on or above the x-axis after rotation and translation.
   - At least one vertex must lie on the x-axis within the bounds of the cup's width `[0, W]`.
   - There must be at least one point of the polygon strictly inside the sauce cup.
   - No point on the sauce cup should lie strictly inside the polygon.

2. **Rotation and Translation:**
   - Iterate through each vertex of the polygon.
   - For each vertex, consider rotating the polygon such that this vertex lies on the x-axis.
   - After rotation, translate the polygon horizontally so that the rotated vertex lies within `[0, W]`.

3. **Checking Constraints:**
   - **All Vertices Above or On X-axis:** Ensure that after rotation and translation, all vertices have a y-coordinate ≥ 0.
   - **Vertex on X-axis Within Cup:** Confirm that the rotated and translated vertex lies between `0` and `W` on the x-axis.
   - **Point Inside Sauce Cup:** Check if at least one point of the polygon lies strictly inside the sauce cup `(0,0)` to `(W,0)` to `(W,D)` to `(0,D)`.
   - **No Sauce Cup Point Inside Polygon:** Ensure that no point on the boundary of the sauce cup lies strictly inside the polygon.

4. **Implementation Details:**
   - **Rotation:** Use rotation matrices to rotate the polygon by the necessary angle.
   - **Translation:** Shift the polygon horizontally and vertically based on the required placement.
   - **Intersection and Containment Checks:** Utilize geometric algorithms to determine if points lie inside polygons and vice versa.

5. **Efficiency Considerations:**
   - Given the small constraints (`N ≤ 20`, `T ≤ 30`), it's feasible to perform these calculations for each test case without significant performance issues.

With these considerations, the following Python code implements the solution:
