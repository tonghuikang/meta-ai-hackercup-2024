**Key Findings:**

1. **Understanding the Problem Requirements:**
   - We need to determine if a convex polygon (chicken tender) can be rotated and translated to fit inside a rectangular sauce cup while satisfying specific geometric conditions.
   - The main conditions include all vertices being above or on the x-axis, at least one vertex lying on the x-axis within the cup's width, some point of the polygon being inside the cup's interior, and ensuring no boundary points of the cup are inside the polygon.

2. **Rotation and Translation Strategy:**
   - For each vertex of the polygon, calculate the rotation angle that would align that vertex onto the x-axis.
   - Rotate the entire polygon by this angle.
   - Translate the polygon horizontally so that the rotated vertex lies within the sauce cup's width `[0, W]`.

3. **Checking Conditions:**
   - **Condition 1:** Verify all rotated and translated vertices lie on or above the x-axis.
   - **Condition 2:** Ensure the specific vertex lies on the x-axis within the bounds `[0, W]`.
   - **Condition 3:** Check if the center of the sauce cup `(W/2, D/2)` lies inside the polygon.
   - **Condition 4:** Sample multiple points along the boundary of the sauce cup and ensure none of these points lie inside the polygon.

4. **Point-in-Polygon Implementation:**
   - Utilize the ray casting algorithm to determine if a point lies within the polygon. This involves casting a horizontal ray from the point and counting how many times it intersects with the polygon's edges.

5. **Sampling Boundary Points:**
   - To efficiently verify that no boundary points of the sauce cup are inside the polygon, sample multiple points along each edge of the cup.

6. **Efficiency Considerations:**
   - Given the small constraints (`N ≤ 20`, `T ≤ 30`), iterating through each vertex and performing the necessary transformations and checks is computationally feasible.
