**Key Findings:**

To determine if a convex polygon (chicken tender) can be rotated and translated to fit into the sauce cup according to the given constraints, we can follow these steps:

1. **Rotation Alignment:**
   - For each vertex of the polygon, calculate the rotation angle needed to align that vertex onto the x-axis. This ensures that the vertex can potentially lie on the bottom of the sauce cup.

2. **Translation within Cup Width:**
   - After rotation, translate the polygon horizontally so that the rotated vertex lies within the bounds of the sauce cup's width `[0, W]`. This involves shifting the polygon such that the vertex's x-coordinate falls within this range.

3. **Constraint Verification:**
   - **All Vertices Above X-axis:** Ensure that after rotation and translation, all vertices have a y-coordinate greater than or equal to zero.
   - **Vertex on X-axis within Cup:** Confirm that at least one vertex lies on the x-axis within the sauce cup's width.
   - **Interior Point Within Sauce Cup:** Check that there's at least one point of the polygon strictly inside the sauce cup's interior `(0 < x < W and 0 < y < D)`.
   - **No Boundary Overlap:** Ensure that no point on the boundary of the sauce cup lies strictly within the polygon, except possibly for the vertex on the x-axis.

4. **Computational Geometry:**
   - Utilize the `shapely` library to perform geometric operations such as rotation, translation, and intersection checks efficiently.

By systematically rotating each vertex to the x-axis and translating the polygon within permissible bounds, we can verify the constraints to decide if the polygon fits perfectly into the sauce cup.
