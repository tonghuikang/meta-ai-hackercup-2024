**Key Findings:**

1. **Convex Polygon Rotation:** Since the chicken tender is a convex polygon, we can iterate over each edge, rotate the polygon so that the edge aligns with the x-axis, and then attempt to place it within the sauce cup.

2. **Rotation and Translation:** For each edge, calculate the angle needed to align it with the x-axis. After rotation, translate the polygon horizontally so that one vertex lies on the x-axis between `0` and `W`.

3. **Condition Checks:**
   - **Vertices Position:** Ensure all vertices are on or above the x-axis after rotation and translation.
   - **Vertex on X-axis:** Confirm at least one vertex lies exactly on the x-axis within the sauce cup's width.
   - **Interior Point:** Check if any point of the polygon lies strictly inside the sauce cup.
   - **No Overlapping:** Ensure no point on the sauce cup lies strictly inside the polygon.

4. **Edge Cases:** Handle scenarios where the polygon cannot fit regardless of rotation or translation, such as when its width exceeds the sauce cup's width even after optimal rotation.

5. **Geometric Computations:** Implement necessary geometric operations like rotation, translation, and point-in-polygon checks efficiently to handle all test cases within the given constraints.
