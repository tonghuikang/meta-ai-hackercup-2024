**Key Findings:**

1. **Rotation Strategy:** To determine if the convex polygon (chicken tender) can fit into the sauce cup, we can rotate the polygon such that each vertex is aligned on the x-axis one at a time. This allows us to systematically check all possible orientations where a vertex lies on the x-axis.

2. **Translation Consideration:** After rotating the polygon to place a vertex on the x-axis, we translate (shift) the polygon horizontally so that the vertex lies within the range \([0, W]\). This ensures that the vertex is positioned correctly within the sauce cup's width.

3. **Conditions Verification:**
   - **Vertices Above X-Axis:** Ensure that after rotation and translation, all vertices of the polygon are on or above the x-axis.
   - **Point Within Sauce Cup:** Check if at least one point of the polygon lies strictly inside the sauce cup's boundaries \((0 < x < W, 0 < y < D)\).
   - **No Overlap with Cup Boundary:** Verify that no point on the sauce cup's boundary lies strictly within the polygon. This ensures that the polygon does not obstruct or cover the cup's sides or bottom improperly.

4. **Geometric Operations:** Utilize geometric libraries (like `shapely`) to handle complex geometric operations such as rotation, translation, and intersection checks. These libraries simplify the process of verifying the spatial conditions required by the problem.

5. **Iterative Checking:** Iterate through each vertex, apply the rotation and translation, and verify all conditions. If any orientation satisfies all the constraints, output "Yes". If none do, output "No".

6. **Numerical Precision:** Handle floating-point operations with care to avoid precision issues, especially when dealing with rotation angles and geometric intersections.
