**Key Findings:**

To determine whether a convex polygon (chicken tender) can be rotated and translated to fit into a sauce cup with specified dimensions, we can follow these steps:

1. **Rotation Candidates:**
   - Iterate through each edge of the polygon and consider rotating the polygon such that one of its vertices lies on the x-axis. This involves calculating the angle required to align the selected edge with the x-axis.

2. **Translation:**
   - After rotation, translate the polygon so that the chosen vertex lies exactly on the x-axis and within the width (`W`) of the sauce cup.

3. **Condition Checks:**
   - **All vertices on or above the x-axis:** Ensure that, after rotation and translation, no vertex of the polygon lies below the x-axis.
   - **At least one vertex on the x-axis within `[0, W]`:** Confirm that at least one vertex is exactly on the x-axis and within the width of the sauce cup.
   - **Presence within the sauce cup:** Verify that some point of the polygon lies strictly inside the bounds of the sauce cup.
   - **No overlap with the sauce cup's interior:** Ensure that no point within the sauce cup lies strictly inside the polygon.

4. **Geometric Computations:**
   - Utilize geometric transformations (rotation and translation) and computational geometry techniques (such as the Separating Axis Theorem) to efficiently check for the above conditions.

By systematically exploring all possible orientations and positions of the polygon and rigorously checking the required conditions, we can determine whether it's possible to fit the chicken tender into the sauce cup.
