To solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given convex polygon (representing the chicken tender) can be rotated and translated to fit into a rectangular sauce cup under specific conditions. Here's a breakdown of the key findings and the approach to solving the problem:

**Key Findings:**

1. **Rotation Alignment:**
   - Since the polygon is convex, we can attempt to align each edge of the polygon with the x-axis. This involves rotating the polygon such that one of its edges lies flat on the x-axis.

2. **Translation Placement:**
   - After rotation, translate the polygon so that one endpoint of the aligned edge lies somewhere between `x=0` and `x=W` on the x-axis. This ensures that the polygon touches the bottom of the sauce cup within its width.

3. **Vertex Positioning:**
   - Ensure that all vertices of the translated polygon are on or above the x-axis. This satisfies the condition that the tender rests on the bottom of the cup without hanging below.

4. **Interior Point Check:**
   - Verify that at least one point of the polygon lies strictly within the bounds of the sauce cup (i.e., `0 < x < W` and `0 < y < D`). This ensures that the tender reaches the bottom of the cup.

5. **Boundary Exclusion:**
   - Ensure that no point on the sauce cup's boundary lies strictly within the polygon. This prevents the tender from protruding beyond the edges of the cup.

6. **Computational Geometry Operations:**
   - Implement geometric transformations such as rotation and translation.
   - Use point-in-polygon tests to verify interior and boundary conditions.
   - Handle floating-point precision issues carefully to avoid incorrect evaluations.

**Approach:**

- Iterate over each edge of the polygon and perform the following steps:
  - **Rotation:** Calculate the angle needed to align the current edge with the x-axis and rotate the entire polygon by this angle.
  - **Translation:** Slide the rotated polygon along the x-axis so that one endpoint of the aligned edge lies within `[0, W]`.
  - **Validation:** Check all the conditions mentioned in the key findings to determine if the current placement is valid.
- If any valid placement is found during the iterations, conclude that the polygon can fit into the sauce cup (`Yes`). If no valid placement is found after trying all possibilities, conclude that it cannot fit (`No`).

The implementation relies on geometric computations and careful consideration of edge cases to ensure accuracy.

**Explanation of the Code:**

- **Rotation and Translation:**
  - `rotate_polygon` rotates the polygon by a given angle.
  - `translate_polygon` translates the polygon by given `dx` and `dy`.

- **Point in Polygon:**
  - `polygon_contains_point` checks if a point lies strictly inside the polygon using the ray casting algorithm.
  - `point_on_polygon` checks if a point lies exactly on any edge of the polygon.

- **Validation Functions:**
  - `any_point_inside_cup` ensures that at least one point of the polygon is strictly within the sauce cup.
  - `no_cup_points_inside_polygon` ensures that no points on the boundary of the sauce cup are strictly inside the polygon.

- **Main Logic (`can_fit` Function):**
  - Iterates over each edge of the polygon, attempting to align it with the x-axis.
  - Rotates and translates the polygon accordingly.
  - Checks all the required conditions using the helper functions.
  - Returns `True` if a valid placement is found; otherwise, `False`.

- **Input Handling:**
  - Reads the number of test cases and processes each case by reading the polygon's vertices and the sauce cup's dimensions.
  - Outputs the result in the specified format.

This implementation systematically explores all possible rotations and translations of the polygon to determine if it can fit into the sauce cup under the given constraints.
