To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given convex polygon (representing a chicken tender) can be rotated and translated to fit perfectly into a sauce cup with specified width \( W \) and depth \( D \). The primary goal is to ensure that the tender touches the bottom of the cup without overlapping the interior boundaries of the cup.

### Key Findings and Approach:

1. **Rotation Alignment**:
   - For the tender to fit into the sauce cup, one of its vertices must lie on the bottom edge of the cup (the \( x \)-axis between \( 0 \) and \( W \)). 
   - To achieve this, we iterate through each vertex of the polygon and consider it as the potential contact point with the cup's bottom.
   - For each vertex, calculate the angle required to rotate the polygon so that this vertex aligns with the \( x \)-axis.

2. **Translation Adjustment**:
   - After rotation, translate the polygon such that the chosen vertex lies exactly on the \( x \)-axis and within the horizontal bounds of the cup (\( 0 \leq x \leq W \)).

3. **Validation Checks**:
   - **Vertices Positioning**: Ensure that after rotation and translation, all vertices of the polygon are on or above the \( x \)-axis.
   - **Cup Interior Check**: Verify that there's at least one point of the polygon strictly within the bounds of the sauce cup (i.e., not on the edges).
   - **Overlap Prevention**: Ensure that no point on the boundary of the sauce cup lies strictly inside the polygon to prevent overlapping.

4. **Iterative Verification**:
   - Repeat the above steps for each vertex of the polygon.
   - If any configuration satisfies all the conditions, output `Yes`. If none do, output `No`.

Given the constraints (\( N \leq 20 \)) and manageable computational requirements, this brute-force approach is feasible and efficient.

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The `readints` function helps in reading input values efficiently.
   - The main function reads the number of test cases and iterates through each, capturing the polygon's vertices and the sauce cup's dimensions.

2. **Rotation and Translation**:
   - `rotate_polygon`: Rotates the polygon by a given angle using the standard rotation matrix.
   - `translate_polygon`: Translates the polygon by specified \( dx \) and \( dy \).

3. **Geometry Checks**:
   - `point_inside_polygon`: Implements the ray casting algorithm to determine if a point lies inside a polygon.
   - `any_point_inside_cup`: Checks if any vertex of the polygon lies strictly inside the sauce cup.
   - `any_cup_point_inside_polygon`: Ensures that no point on the sauce cup's boundary is strictly inside the polygon, preventing overlap.

4. **Fitting Logic**:
   - `can_fit`: Core function that attempts to fit the polygon into the sauce cup by iterating over each vertex, rotating, translating, and validating the conditions mentioned earlier.

5. **Execution Flow**:
   - The `main` function orchestrates the reading of input, processing each test case, and outputting the results in the required format.

This approach systematically checks all possible orientations and positions of the polygon to determine if it can be seamlessly integrated into the sauce cup.
