To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given convex polygon (representing a chicken tender) can be rotated and translated to fit into a rectangular sauce cup under specific constraints. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:

### **Key Findings**

1. **Rotation to Align a Vertex with the X-axis:**
   - For each vertex of the polygon, compute the angle needed to rotate the polygon such that this vertex lies on the x-axis.
   - This involves calculating the angle between the vertex and the x-axis using trigonometric functions.

2. **Translation Along the X-axis:**
   - After rotation, translate the polygon along the x-axis so that the rotated vertex lies within the bounds `[0, W]` of the sauce cup.
   - This ensures that the vertex touches the bottom of the sauce cup.

3. **Validation of Constraints:**
   - **All Vertices Above or On the X-axis:** Ensure that, post-rotation and translation, all vertices of the polygon lie on or above the x-axis.
   - **Vertex on the X-axis Within Cup Width:** Confirm that at least one vertex lies exactly on the x-axis between `0` and `W`.
   - **Polygon Contains a Point Strictly Within the Sauce Cup:** Check if there's at least one point inside the polygon that lies strictly within the bounds `(0, W)` in the x-direction and `(0, D)` in the y-direction.
   - **No Points of the Sauce Cup Inside the Polygon:** Ensure that no point on the boundary of the sauce cup is strictly inside the polygon.

4. **Geometric Computations:**
   - **Rotation:** Implement rotation of the polygon around the origin using rotation matrices.
   - **Translation:** Adjust the position of the rotated polygon so that the selected vertex aligns within the sauce cup.
   - **Point Inclusion Tests:** Utilize geometric algorithms like the ray-casting method to determine if points lie inside the polygon.

5. **Handling Floating-Point Precision:**
   - Use a small epsilon value to account for floating-point inaccuracies when performing geometric comparisons.

6. **Iterative Testing:**
   - Iterate through each vertex, perform the rotation and translation, and validate the constraints. If any configuration satisfies all conditions, return `"Yes"`; otherwise, return `"No"`.

### **Python Code Implementation**

Below is the Python code that implements the above approach:

```python

    return list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))

    cos_theta = math.cos(angle_rad)
    sin_theta = math.sin(angle_rad)
    rotated = []
    for x, y in polygon:
        xr = x * cos_theta - y * sin_theta
        yr = x * sin_theta + y * cos_theta
