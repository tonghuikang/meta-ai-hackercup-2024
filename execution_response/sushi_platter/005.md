To approach this problem efficiently, we need to consider the given constraints carefully. Here's the optimized way to solve the problem:

**Key Observations:**

1. **Nigiri Always Have Lower Tastiness Values Than Sashimi:**
   - Nigiri tastiness values \( A_i \) are between 1 and 100.
   - Sashimi tastiness values \( B_i \) are between 101 and \( 10^9 \).

2. **Insertion of Sashimi Into Nigiri Sequence:**
   - Our goal is to count the number of ways to interleave the nigiri and sashimi pieces such that the total unevenness doesn't exceed \( L \).
   - We can fix the order of nigiri pieces (sorted order) because rearranging them has negligible impact on the total unevenness compared to the differences introduced by sashimi pieces.
   - Since \( M \leq 5 \), the number of permutations of sashimi pieces is manageable (up to \( 5! = 120 \)).

3. **Compute the Total Unevenness Efficiently:**
   - Precompute the sum of adjacent differences for the sorted nigiri sequence and for each permutation of sashimi pieces.
   - For each way of inserting the sashimi pieces into the nigiri sequence, we need to compute the additional unevenness introduced due to adjacent sashimi-nigiri pairs.
   - The number of ways to insert \( M \) sashimi into \( N+1 \) gaps is \( \binom{N+M}{M} \).

4. **Optimizations:**
   - Precompute all possible differences between any nigiri and any sashimi pieces.
   - Use efficient looping and summation to ensure per-arrangement computation is quick.
   - Prune any arrangement early if the total unevenness exceeds \( L \).

Implementing these observations, we can create a Python program that iterates through all necessary permutations and insertions while staying within acceptable time constraints.

**Key Findings While Solving the Problem:**

- **Permutation Complexity:** Enumerating all permutations is infeasible for \( N \leq 50 \). Therefore, fixing the nigiri order and focusing on the permutations of sashimi (since \( M \leq 5 \)) is crucial.
  
- **Optimization via Precomputed Differences:** Precomputing differences between nigiri and sashimi, and reducing per-arrangement computation time, makes the algorithm practical within time constraints.

- **Efficient Combination Processing:** By processing combinations in chunks and using iterators, we avoid excessive memory usage and keep processing time acceptable.

- **Pruning Unnecessary Computations:** Early exit from loops when the total unevenness exceeds \( L \) ensures that we don't waste time on invalid arrangements.

This approach ensures that, even with the maximum values of \( N \) and \( M \), the program remains efficient and completes within reasonable time limits.
