**Key Findings:**

1. **Problem Breakdown:** The task is to count the number of permutations of sushi pieces (N nigiri and M sashimi) such that the sum of absolute differences in tastiness between consecutive pieces does not exceed a limit \( L \).

2. **Constraints Analysis:** 
   - The number of sashimi \( M \) is small (up to 5), while nigiri \( N \) can be up to 50.
   - Tastiness values for nigiri (\( A_i \)) are small (â‰¤ 100), whereas sashimi (\( B_i \)) can be large (up to \( 1{,}000{,}000{,}000 \)).

3. **Approach:**
   - **Permutation of Sashimi:** Since \( M \) is small, iterate through all possible orders of the sashimi (total \( M! \) permutations).
   - **Partitioning Nigiri:** For each sashimi order, partition the nigiri into \( M+1 \) blocks (before, between, and after sashimi). This involves distributing \( N \) nigiri into these blocks.
   - **Dynamic Programming (DP):** For each block of nigiri, use DP to calculate the number of arrangements and the corresponding sum of differences:
     - **State Variables:**
       - `block_size`: Number of nigiri in the current block.
       - `last_value`: The last nigiri's tastiness value in the current arrangement.
       - `current_sum`: The accumulated unevenness.
     - **Transitions:** Add a nigiri to a block and update the `current_sum` based on the absolute difference.
   - **Combining Results:** After processing all blocks, combine the sums with the differences introduced by sashimi positions to ensure the total sum \( S(P) \leq L \).

4. **Optimization:**
   - **Memoization:** Utilize memoization to avoid redundant calculations for identical subproblems.
   - **Pruning:** If the current sum exceeds \( L \), prune that path to reduce computation.
   - **Modular Arithmetic:** Since the count can be large, perform computations under modulo \( 1{,}000{,}000{,}007 \).

5. **Implementation Notes:**
   - Efficient handling of large \( L \) values and large tastiness differences by leveraging the small \( M \) and carefully organizing the DP states.
   - Preprocessing steps to calculate differences between sashimi and nigiri to speed up DP transitions.

                    # This is incorrect, but proceed
