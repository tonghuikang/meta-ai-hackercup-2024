**Key Findings:**

1. **Problem Breakdown:**
   - We need to count the number of permutations of \(N + M\) sushi pieces (with \(N \leq 50\) and \(M \leq 5\)) such that the total "unevenness score" \(S(P)\) does not exceed a given limit \(L\).

2. **Distinctness and Value Ranges:**
   - Nigiri (\(A_i\)) have tastiness values between 1 and 100.
   - Sashimi (\(B_i\)) have tastiness values between 101 and \(10^9\).
   - All tastiness values are distinct, ensuring unique permutations.

3. **Key Observations:**
   - Since \(M\) (the number of sashimi) is small (up to 5), we can leverage this to manage the complexity.
   - The large differences between \(A_i\) and \(B_i\) imply that transitions between nigiri and sashimi will contribute significantly to the unevenness score.
   - It's optimal to group similar types (nigiri or sashimi) together to minimize the unevenness score.

4. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - **State Representation:** Use a DP state that keeps track of:
     - The subset of sashimi pieces used (represented as a bitmask since \(M \leq 5\)).
     - The last type of sushi placed (either nigiri or a specific sashimi piece).
     - The current accumulated unevenness score.
   - **Transition Logic:**
     - When placing a nigiri, consider all remaining nigiri and calculate the new difference based on the last placed sushi.
     - When placing a sashimi, iterate over all possible sashimi pieces not yet used and calculate the new difference accordingly.
   - **Pruning:** Since \(L\) can be up to \(10^9\), it's crucial to prune states where the accumulated score exceeds \(L\) to keep the DP manageable.
   - **Modulo Operation:** Since the number of permutations can be large, all counts are calculated modulo \(1{,}000{,}000{,}007\).

5. **Implementation Details:**
   - Precompute all possible differences between sushi pieces to speed up the DP transitions.
   - Optimize the DP by iterating through sashimi placements and dynamically placing nigiri around them.
   - Utilize memoization to avoid redundant computations.
