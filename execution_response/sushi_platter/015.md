**Key Findings:**

To solve the problem of counting the number of valid sushi platter permutations with an unevenness score \( S(P) \leq L \), we can leverage dynamic programming (DP) combined with the constraints provided:

1. **Distinct Tastiness Values:** Each piece of sushi has a unique tastiness value, with nigiri values \( A_i \leq 100 \) and sashimi values \( B_i \geq 101 \). This separation allows us to exploit the distinct ranges for efficient state representation.

2. **Small \( M \) (Number of Sashimi):** Since \( M \leq 5 \), we can represent the state of used sashimi pieces using a bitmask. This significantly reduces the state space related to sashimi.

3. **Large \( N \) (Number of Nigiri):** With \( N \leq 50 \), tracking each nigiri's usage individually would be computationally expensive. Instead, we'll track the count of used nigiri pieces and handle their contributions implicitly.

4. **Dynamic Programming State:** The DP state can be defined by:
   - **Last Item Placed:** To compute the difference when adding a new piece.
   - **Sashimi Mask:** Which sashimi pieces have been used so far.
   - **Current Unevenness Sum:** Accumulated sum of absolute differences.

5. **Efficiency with Sum Tracking:** Given that \( L \) can be up to \( 10^9 \), tracking the sum explicitly isn't feasible. Instead, we'll use optimized data structures (like `defaultdict`) to manage the possible sums efficiently, ensuring we only store relevant states that contribute to \( S(P) \leq L \).

6. **Modulo Operation:** Since the result can be large, we'll take all counts modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) to prevent integer overflow and conform to the problem's requirements.

With these insights, we can construct a dynamic programming solution that efficiently counts the valid permutations while respecting the constraints.
