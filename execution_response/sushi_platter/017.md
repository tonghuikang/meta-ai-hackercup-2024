**Key Findings:**

1. **Problem Breakdown:**
   - We need to count the number of permutations of `N` nigiri and `M` sashimi pieces such that the total unevenness score `S(P)` does not exceed a given limit `L`.
   - Each piece of nigiri (`A_i`) has a distinct tastiness value between 1 and 100.
   - Each piece of sashimi (`B_i`) has a distinct tastiness value between 101 and 1,000,000,000.
   - The total number of sushi pieces is `n = N + M`, which can be up to 55.

2. **Constraints Utilization:**
   - Given that `M` (number of sashimi) is small (up to 5), we can leverage this to optimize our solution.
   - The difference between any two nigiri pieces is at most 99, while the difference between any nigiri and sashimi is at least 1 (and often large due to the separation in tastiness ranges).
   - The large value of `L` (up to 1,000,000,000) implies that many permutations might satisfy the condition, but we still need an efficient way to count them without enumerating all possible permutations.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - We'll use dynamic programming (DP) where the state is defined by:
     - The mask representing which sashimi pieces have been used.
     - The last piece's tastiness value.
     - The count of nigiri pieces used.
   - The DP will keep track of the minimum unevenness score for each state and count the number of valid permutations.
   - Since `M` is small, the mask can efficiently represent the usage of sashimi pieces, and we can iterate over possible placements of sashimi within the nigiri.

4. **Modulo Operation:**
   - Since the number of valid permutations can be very large, we take the result modulo `1,000,000,007` as required.

5. **Efficiency Considerations:**
   - By leveraging the small value of `M` and the distinct ranges of `A_i` and `B_i`, we can optimize our DP transitions.
   - Pre-sorting the sushi pieces can help in efficiently calculating differences and managing states.
