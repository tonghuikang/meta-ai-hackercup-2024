**Key Findings:**

1. **Distinct Tastiness Groups:**
   - The sushi pieces are divided into two distinct categories based on their tastiness values:
     - **Nigiri (A-type):** \( N \) pieces with tastiness values \( A_i \) ranging from 1 to 100.
     - **Sashimi (B-type):** \( M \) pieces with tastiness values \( B_i \) ranging from 101 to \( 10^9 \).
   - There is no overlap between the tastiness values of A-type and B-type sushi.

2. **Transition Differences:**
   - **Within A-type Sushi:** The maximum difference between consecutive pieces is limited (up to 99 since \( A_i \leq 100 \)).
   - **Within B-type Sushi:** The differences can be very large due to the wide range of \( B_i \) values.
   - **Between A-type and B-type Sushi:** The differences are at least \( 1 \) (since \( B_i \geq 101 \) and \( A_i \leq 100 \)) but can be large depending on the specific values.

3. **Permutation Constraints:**
   - To minimize the unevenness score \( S(P) \), it's optimal to group all A-type sushi together and all B-type sushi together. This minimizes the number of large transitions between A and B types.
   - There are two primary ways to arrange the groups:
     - All A-type sushi followed by all B-type sushi.
     - All B-type sushi followed by all A-type sushi.
   - Within each group, arranging the sushi in ascending or descending order can further optimize the unevenness score.

4. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - Given the constraints (\( N \leq 50 \), \( M \leq 5 \), and \( L \leq 10^{9} \)), a dynamic programming (DP) approach is feasible by leveraging the small size of \( M \).
   - The DP state can be defined based on the number of A-type and B-type sushi used, the last type placed, and the current accumulated unevenness.
   - Due to the potentially large value of \( L \), it's essential to implement optimizations such as:
     - **State Compression:** Reduce the state space by focusing on relevant transitions.
     - **Pruning:** Disregard paths that exceed the allowed unevenness \( L \).
     - **Memoization:** Cache intermediate results to avoid redundant computations.

5. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - Since the number of valid permutations can be very large, all calculations are performed modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) to manage computational limits.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - Ensure that permutations where all A-type or all B-type sushi are placed without mixing are correctly accounted for.
   - Handle cases where \( N \) or \( M \) is zero, representing scenarios with only one type of sushi.
