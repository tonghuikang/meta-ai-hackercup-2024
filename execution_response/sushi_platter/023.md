**Key Findings:**

1. **Separation of Piece Types:** Given that nigiri (A) pieces have tastiness values between 1 and 100, and sashimi (B) pieces have values starting from 101, the differences between A and B pieces are inherently large. To minimize the unevenness score \( S(P) \), it's optimal to group B pieces together and A pieces together.

2. **Small Number of B Pieces:** With \( M \leq 5 \), the number of sashimi pieces is small. This allows us to consider all possible ways to interleave the B pieces within the sequence of A pieces without incurring a combinatorial explosion.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - **State Definition:** The DP state can be defined by the number of A and B pieces used so far, the last piece type (A or B), and the current accumulated unevenness score.
   - **Transitions:** At each step, decide whether to place an A piece or a B piece next, updating the unevenness score accordingly.
   - **Pruning:** Since \( L \) can be as large as \( 10^9 \), it's essential to prune states that exceed the allowed unevenness to keep the solution efficient.

4. **Precomputation of Differences:** To optimize transitions, precompute the absolute differences between all A and B pieces, as well as among A pieces themselves. This reduces the computation required during the DP transitions.

5. **Modulo Operation:** Since the number of valid permutations can be very large, all counts should be computed modulo \( 1{,}000{,}000{,}007 \) to prevent integer overflow and to comply with the problem's requirements.

6. **Efficient Memory Management:** Given the constraints, it's crucial to manage memory efficiently, possibly by using memoization techniques and compressing the DP state where feasible.

With these insights, we can implement a dynamic programming solution that efficiently counts the number of valid permutations.

        # Another Idea:
        # Use DP with last piece type and some group properties
        # But it's tricky.

        # Practical Approach:
        # Given tight constraints, and small M, assume B's must be placed consecutively
        # and compute the number of ways to arrange A's and B's accordingly.

        # Number of ways to arrange A's and B's is C(N+M, M) * N! * M!

        # To minimize the sum, place B's together and A's in sorted order
        # To maximize the sum, place B's far from A's.

        # Since L can be up to 1e9, and differences involving B's can be up to 1e9,
        # it's too complex to handle normally.
