When solving this problem, the key insights involve leveraging the small number of sashimi pieces (M ≤ 5) compared to the potentially larger number of nigiri pieces (N ≤ 50). Here's a breakdown of the approach:

1. **Permutations of Sashimi (B's):**
   - Since M is small, we can enumerate all M! permutations of the sashimi. For each permutation, we consider how to interleave the nigiri.

2. **Partitioning Nigiri into Blocks:**
   - For each permutation of B's, we divide the sorted list of A's (nigiri) into M+1 contiguous blocks. This corresponds to placing the sashimi between these blocks.
   - The number of ways to partition N nigiri into M+1 blocks is given by combinations, specifically C(N+M, M).

3. **Arranging Blocks:**
   - Each block of A's can be arranged either in ascending or descending order. This adds a factor of 2 for each block, resulting in 2^(M+1) possible arrangements for each partitioning.
   - For each arrangement, calculate the internal sum of differences within the blocks and the transitions between blocks and B's.

4. **Calculating Unevenness Score:**
   - For each specific arrangement of A's and permutation of B's, compute the total unevenness score S(P).
   - If S(P) ≤ L, count this as a valid permutation.

5. **Optimization:**
   - Precompute the internal sums for sorted A's to quickly calculate the sums for any block.
   - Efficiently iterate through all possible partitions and block arrangements, leveraging Python's speed optimizations where possible.

Given the constraints, this approach is feasible since the number of permutations and block arrangements remains manageable due to the small value of M.

Below is the Python implementation adhering to this strategy:

```python

import math
import itertools

    B = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
    A_sorted = sorted(A)
    # Precompute prefix sums for internal sums
    prefix_internal_sum = [0] * (N+1)
    for i in range(1, N):
        prefix_internal_sum[i] = prefix_internal_sum[i-1] + (A_sorted[i] - A_sorted[i-1])
    prefix_internal_sum[N] = prefix_internal_sum[N-1]
    # Generate all permutations of B
    B_perms = list(itertools.permutations(B))
    count = 0
    # Precompute all possible splits
    # Splits are M+1 blocks, need to choose M split points among N
    # Using itertools.combinations
    split_combinations = list(itertools.combinations(range(N+1), M))
    for B_perm in B_perms:
        for splits in split_combinations:
            # splits is a tuple of M split points, in increasing order
            # Define block ranges

                prev = s
            blocks.append( (prev, N) )
            # Now, for each block, decide sorted or reversed
            # 2^(M+1) options

                for k in range(M):
                    Bk = B_perm[k]
                    Bk_plus_1 = B_perm[k+1] if k+1 < M else None
                    # Transition between block k and Bk
                    if block_last[k] is not None:
