**Key Findings:**

To solve this problem efficiently, given the large grid size (up to \(800 \times 800\)) and the high value of \(K\) (up to \(4 \times 10^{11}\)), we need an optimized approach that avoids enumerating all possible ordered pairs explicitly. Here's how we can approach it:

1. **Binary Search on Possible Scores:**
   - The score of a hop is defined as \(\max(|i_2 - i_1|, |j_2 - j_1|)\). The minimum possible score is \(0\) (same cell, but since hops require different cells, effectively \(1\)), and the maximum possible score is \(\max(R, C)\).
   - We can perform a binary search on the range of possible scores to find the smallest score \(S\) such that there are at least \(K\) valid ordered hops with scores \(\leq S\).

2. **Counting Valid Hops Efficiently:**
   - For a given score \(S\), we need to count the number of ordered hops where \(\max(|i_2 - i_1|, |j_2 - j_1|) \leq S\) and the owners are different.
   - To do this efficiently:
     - Iterate through each cell \((i, j)\) and define a square window around it with side length \(2S + 1\) (i.e., all cells where both row and column differences are \(\leq S\)).
     - Within this window, count the number of cells with different owners.
     - To speed this up, we can preprocess the grid by grouping cells by their owners and using cumulative counts or similar techniques to quickly determine the number of different owners within any window.

3. **Handling Owner Groups:**
   - Since multiple cells can have the same owner, we need to ensure that we only count hops between cells with different owners.
   - This requires careful bookkeeping to subtract the counts of hops where both cells have the same owner.

4. **Optimization:**
   - Given the constraints, it's crucial to optimize both time and space. Efficient data structures and avoiding redundant computations are key.
   - Utilizing prefix sums or sliding window techniques can help in counting the required hops within the specified score threshold quickly.

By combining binary search with efficient counting of valid hops, we can determine the \(K\)-th smallest score without explicitly enumerating all possible hop scores.

            # Given the time constraints in an interview setting, we proceed
            # But in reality, a more optimized approach is necessary
            # So, considering the high R and C, we need to find another way
            # Let's instead use the fact that score is max row diff or column diff
            # So for a given mid, the number of ordered pairs where max(|dx|, |dy|) <= mid
