**Key Findings**:

To solve this problem efficiently, especially given the large grid sizes (up to \(800 \times 800\)) and the potentially enormous number of hops (up to \(4 \times 10^{11}\)), the following approach is adopted:

1. **Binary Search on Possible Scores**:
   - The possible score values range from 0 to \(\max(R, C)\).
   - Perform a binary search to find the smallest score \(S\) such that the number of valid ordered hops with scores \(\leq S\) is at least \(K\).

2. **Counting Valid Hops for a Given Score \(S\)**:
   - **Total Ordered Pairs with Score \(\leq S\)**:
     - For each cell, the number of cells within a square of side \(2S + 1\) centered at that cell defines the number of valid hops originating from it.
     - Due to grid boundaries, adjust the count accordingly.
     - The total number of such ordered pairs can be computed efficiently using a precomputed cumulative sum (prefix sum) approach.

   - **Subtracting Pairs with the Same Owner**:
     - For each unique owner, count the number of ordered pairs of their own cells that are within the score \(S\).
     - This requires iterating through each owner and, for their cell positions, counting how many other cells owned by the same bunny are within the \(S\) distance.
     - Efficiently implemented using spatial indexing or leveraging cumulative sums for rapid overlap counting.

3. **Optimizations**:
   - Utilize NumPy for fast array operations, especially when handling large grids and performing bulk calculations.
   - Precompute and store positions of cells for each owner to expedite the subtraction step during the counting process.
   - Leverage symmetry and mathematical properties of the problem to reduce computational overhead during counting.

By iteratively narrowing down the search space with binary search and efficiently counting valid hops using optimized array operations, the solution efficiently finds the \(K\)-th smallest score even for large inputs.
