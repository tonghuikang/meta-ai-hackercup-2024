To solve this problem efficiently, especially given the large constraints, we can leverage a **binary search** approach combined with **grid-based arithmetic calculations**. Here's a breakdown of the key findings and the approach:

### **Key Findings and Approach:**

1. **Binary Search on Score (`s`):**
   - **Objective:** Find the smallest score `s` such that the number of valid hops with scores ≤ `s` is at least `K`.
   - **Strategy:** Use binary search within the possible range of scores (from `0` to `max(R, C)`) to identify this `s`.

2. **Counting Total Ordered Pairs with Score ≤ `s`:**
   - **Calculation:** For each cell, the number of cells within a square of size `(2s+1) x (2s+1)` centered on it gives the number of cells reachable with a score ≤ `s`.
   - **Optimization:** Instead of iterating through each cell, calculate the sum based on the grid dimensions and handle boundary conditions mathematically for efficiency.

3. **Counting Same-Owner Ordered Pairs with Score ≤ `s`:**
   - **Challenge:** Efficiently count ordered pairs of cells owned by the same bunny where the score (distance) is ≤ `s`.
   - **Solution:** 
     - Group cells by their owners.
     - For each owner with multiple cells, sort their cells by rows and columns.
     - Use a sliding window approach to count the number of ordered pairs within the distance `s`.

4. **Determining Valid Hops:**
   - **Calculation:** The number of valid hops with scores ≤ `s` is the total ordered pairs with scores ≤ `s` minus the same-owner ordered pairs with scores ≤ `s`.
   - **Comparison:** If this number is ≥ `K`, attempt to find a smaller `s`. Otherwise, search for a larger `s`.

5. **Efficiency Considerations:**
   - **Time Complexity:** The approach ensures that each test case is processed efficiently without enumerating all possible pairs, which would be computationally infeasible given the constraints.
   - **Space Complexity:** Memory usage is optimized by processing each test case independently and using efficient data structures like dictionaries for grouping owners.

### **Python Code Implementation:**

```python
import sys
import threading

def main():
    import sys
    import bisect
    from collections import defaultdict

    T = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    for test_case in range(1, T+1):
        R, C, K = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
        grid = []
        owner_cells = defaultdict(list)
        for i in range(1, R+1):
            row = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
            grid.append(row)
            for j in range(1, C+1):
                owner = row[j-1]
                owner_cells[owner].append( (i, j) )

                # For each cell, count number of cells within s distance
                # Using two pointers
                # Since max distance is max row difference and max column difference,
                # use nested loops approach
                # To optimize, we can sort by row and then for each row window, use column window
                # But for simplicity, use brute force for small m
                # Given constraints, m can be up to 640k, but likely much smaller per owner
                # Thus, use grid-based counting
                # Create a grid for this owner's cells
