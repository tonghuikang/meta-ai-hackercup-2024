**Key Findings:**

1. **Problem Reduction:**
   - We need to find the K-th smallest score from all valid ordered pairs of burrows where the owners are different. The score is defined as the maximum of the absolute differences in row and column indices between the two burrows.

2. **Binary Search Approach:**
   - The possible scores range from `1` to `max(R-1, C-1)`. We can perform a binary search within this range to efficiently find the K-th smallest score.
   
3. **Counting Valid Pairs (`F(s)`):**
   - For a given score `s`, we calculate `F(s)`, the number of ordered pairs with different owners and a score less than or equal to `s`.
   - `F(s)` can be derived as:
     \[
     F_{\text{different}}(s) = F_{\text{total}}(s) - \sum_b A_b(s)
     \]
     Where:
     - `F_total(s)` is the total number of ordered pairs with a score ≤ `s`.
     - `A_b(s)` is the number of ordered pairs for owner `b` where the score ≤ `s`.
   
4. **Efficient Computation with Numpy:**
   - To compute `A_b(s)` efficiently for each owner, we use Numpy's 2D convolution capabilities. This allows us to quickly count the number of same-owner pairs within a distance `s`.
   
5. **Handling Large Grids:**
   - Given the potentially large grid sizes (up to 800x800) and multiple test cases (up to 50), the implementation leverages Numpy's optimized operations to handle computations efficiently.

6. **Final Steps:**
   - For each test case, perform a binary search to find the smallest score `s` such that `F(s) >= K`.
   - Once found, output `s` as the K-th smallest score.

Below is the Python implementation based on the above findings:

                window = np.ones((window_size, window_size), dtype=np.int32)
