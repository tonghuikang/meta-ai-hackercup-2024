**Key Findings:**

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to identify the K-th smallest score from all possible ordered pairs of hops between different-owner burrows on an \( R \times C \) grid.
   - The score for a hop is determined by the Chebyshev distance: \( \max(|i_2 - i_1|, |j_2 - j_1|) \).
   - Given the large constraints (\( R, C \leq 800 \)), it's impractical to enumerate all possible pairs directly due to the potential of up to \( 4 \times 10^{11} \) ordered pairs.

2. **Efficient Counting with Binary Search:**
   - Utilize binary search over possible distance scores \( s \) (ranging from 0 to \( \max(R, C) \)) to find the smallest \( s \) such that the number of valid hops with scores \( \leq s \) is at least \( K \).
   - For each candidate \( s \), compute:
     - **Total Ordered Pairs with Distance \( \leq s \):** This can be efficiently calculated by iterating over possible row and column differences (\( \Delta i, \Delta j \)) up to \( s \) and summing up the valid cell combinations.
     - **Same-Owner Pairs with Distance \( \leq s \):** To ensure hops are between different owners, subtract pairs of cells owned by the same bunny. This requires grouping cells by their owners and efficiently counting pairs within the distance \( s \) for each owner.
   - The \( K \)-th smallest score corresponds to the smallest \( s \) where the cumulative count of valid hops meets or exceeds \( K \).

3. **Optimizing Same-Owner Pair Counting:**
   - Since multiple cells can belong to the same owner, we group cells by their owner IDs.
   - For each owner with multiple cells, sort their cell positions and use a sliding window (two-pointer technique) to count the number of ordered pairs within the distance \( s \).
   - This approach ensures that we efficiently handle up to \( 640,000 \) cells without excessive computational overhead.

4. **Implementation Considerations:**
   - Given the large input size, it's crucial to read the input efficiently, ideally by reading all input at once and processing it.
   - Utilize efficient data structures like dictionaries to group cells by their owners and lists to manage cell positions.
   - Carefully handle edge cases, such as all cells belonging to the same owner or minimal grid sizes.
