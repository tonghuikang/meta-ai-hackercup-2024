**Key Findings:**

1. **Distance Definition:** The distance between two burrows \((i_1, j_1)\) and \((i_2, j_2)\) is defined as \(\max(|i_2 - i_1|, |j_2 - j_1|)\). This forms a square region around each cell.

2. **Binary Search Approach:** Given the large grid size (\(R, C \leq 800\)), enumerating all possible hops is computationally infeasible. Instead, we can employ a binary search on the possible distance values to efficiently find the \(K\)-th smallest score.

3. **Counting Valid Hops:**
   - **Total Pairs within Distance \(D\):** For a given distance \(D\), calculate the total number of unordered cell pairs where the distance is \(\leq D\).
   - **Same-Owner Pairs:** Subtract the number of unordered pairs where both cells are owned by the same bunny within the distance \(D\).
   - **Different-Owner Pairs:** Multiply the resulting unordered pairs by 2 to account for ordered pairs.

4. **Prefix Sums for Efficient Counting:** To efficiently compute the number of cell pairs within a certain distance, prefix sums can be utilized. However, handling same-owner pairs requires careful optimization to avoid excessive memory and computation, especially since the number of owners can be large.

5. **Optimization Considerations:** 
   - Group cells by their owners to streamline the counting of same-owner pairs.
   - Use efficient data structures and algorithms to handle large inputs within the time constraints.

The Python code below implements the above approach:

        R, C, K = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
        grid = []
        owner_cells = defaultdict(list)
        for i in range(R):
            row = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
            grid.append(row)
            for j in range(C):
                owner = row[j]
                owner_cells[owner].append((i, j))

        # Use binary search to find the smallest D where the number of different-owner ordered pairs >= K
