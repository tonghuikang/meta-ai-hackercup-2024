When solving this problem, the key insights are:

1. **Binary Search on Scores**: The possible scores (S) range from 0 to the maximum of R and C. We use binary search to efficiently find the smallest S such that the number of valid hops with scores ≤ S is at least K.

2. **Counting Valid Hops**:
   - **Total Pairs with Score ≤ S**: For a given S, calculate the total number of ordered pairs of burrows where the hop score is ≤ S. This can be done using combinatorial formulas based on grid dimensions.
   - **Subtracting Same-Owner Pairs**: Some of these pairs have the same owner, which are invalid. We subtract these from the total. To efficiently count same-owner pairs within distance S, we use a two-pointer technique combined with binary search on sorted column lists for each bunny with multiple burrows.

3. **Efficient Implementation**: Given the large possible size of the grid (up to 800x800), it's crucial to implement the counting of same-owner pairs efficiently, ensuring that the solution runs within acceptable time limits.

Below is the Python implementation encapsulating these ideas:

```python
import sys
import bisect

def count_ordered_pairs_within_S(cells, S):
    # Sort cells by row, then by column
    cells_sorted = sorted(cells, key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))
    n = len(cells_sorted)
    count = 0
    left = 0
    sorted_cols = []
    for right in range(n):
        row_r, col_r = cells_sorted[right]
        # Move left pointer to keep row difference <= S
        while row_r - cells_sorted[left][0] > S:
            # Remove cells_sorted[left][1] from sorted_cols
            idx = bisect.bisect_left(sorted_cols, cells_sorted[left][1])
            if idx < len(sorted_cols) and sorted_cols[idx] == cells_sorted[left][1]:
                sorted_cols.pop(idx)
            left +=1
        # Now, cells from left to right have row difference <= S
        # Count number of cells with col in [col_r - S, col_r + S]
        low = col_r - S
        high = col_r + S
        l = bisect.bisect_left(sorted_cols, low)
        r_idx = bisect.bisect_right(sorted_cols, high)
        count += r_idx - l
        # Insert current column into sorted_cols
        bisect.insort(sorted_cols, col_r)
    # Each pair is counted once (a,b) where a is the right cell and b is within S
    # Now, to get ordered pairs, it's the same as count
    # Subtract the self-pairs (a,b) where a == b, which are exactly len(cells)
    count -= len(cells)
    return count

        total_pairs = (2 * mid * R - mid * (mid +1) + R) * (2 * mid * C - mid * (mid +1) + C) - R*C
        # Compute same_owner_pairs(mid)
        same_owner_pairs =0
        for cells in bunnies_multi.values():
