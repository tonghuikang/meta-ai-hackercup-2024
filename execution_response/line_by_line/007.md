To solve this problem, we need to determine how much the probability \( P \) must increase to ensure that typing \( N \) lines of code with the improved probability results in the same success rate as typing \( N-1 \) lines with the original probability.

### Key Findings:

1. **Success Probability for \( N \) Lines**:
   - The probability of successfully typing \( N \) lines without any mistakes is \( \left(\frac{P}{100}\right)^N \).

2. **Success Probability for \( N-1 \) Lines**:
   - Similarly, the probability of successfully typing \( N-1 \) lines is \( \left(\frac{P}{100}\right)^{N-1} \).

3. **Equating the Success Probabilities**:
   - To make the success probability of typing \( N \) lines with an improved probability \( P_{\text{new}} \) equal to that of typing \( N-1 \) lines with the original probability \( P \), we set:
     \[
     \left(\frac{P_{\text{new}}}{100}\right)^N = \left(\frac{P}{100}\right)^{N-1}
     \]

4. **Solving for \( P_{\text{new}} \)**:
   - Taking the natural logarithm of both sides and solving for \( P_{\text{new}} \), we get:
     \[
     P_{\text{new}} = 100 \times \left(\frac{P}{100}\right)^{\frac{N-1}{N}}
     \]
   
5. **Calculating the Increase in \( P \)**:
   - The required increase in \( P \) is therefore:
     \[
     \text{Increase} = P_{\text{new}} - P
     \]

6. **Implementation Considerations**:
   - Use floating-point arithmetic to maintain precision.
   - Ensure the output has sufficient decimal places to meet the error tolerance.

### Python Implementation:

```python
import math

def solve():
    import sys
    T_and_cases = sys.stdin.read().split()
    T = int(T_and_cases[0])
    idx =1
    for tc in range(1, T+1):
        N = int(T_and_cases[idx])
        P = int(T_and_cases[idx+1])
        idx +=2
        if P ==0:
            # If P is 0, no increase can make it possible
            increase =0.0
        else:
            P_fraction = P /100.0
            exponent = (N-1)/N
            P_new_fraction = math.pow(P_fraction, exponent)
            P_new = P_new_fraction *100.0
            increase = P_new - P
        print(f"Case #{tc}: {increase}")
```
