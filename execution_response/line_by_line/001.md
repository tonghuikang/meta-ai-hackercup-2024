**Key Findings:**

1. **Probability Comparison:** 
   - **Original Approach:** Typing \( N \) lines with each line having a success probability of \( P \% \) results in a total success probability of \( (P/100)^N \).
   - **Alternative Approach:** Typing \( N-1 \) lines with the same success probability \( P \% \) yields a total success probability of \( (P/100)^{N-1} \).

2. **Determining the Required Increase in \( P \):**
   - To have the same success probability as the alternative approach while typing \( N \) lines, we need to find a new probability \( Q \) such that \( Q^N = (P/100)^{N-1} \).
   - Solving for \( Q \), we get \( Q = (P/100)^{(N-1)/N} \times 100 \).
   - The required increase in \( P \) is then \( Q - P \).

3. **Handling Edge Cases and Precision:**
   - Ensure that calculations are handled using floating-point arithmetic to maintain precision, especially for large \( N \) or very small \( P \).
   - The final output should be precise within an absolute or relative error of \( 10^{-6} \).

**Python Code:**

```python
import math

def solve():
    import sys
    T = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    for tc in range(1, T+1):
        line = sys.stdin.readline()
        while line.strip() == '':
            line = sys.stdin.readline()
        N_str, P_str = line.strip().split()
        N = int(N_str)
        P = float(P_str)
        P_frac = P / 100.0
        # Compute Q = (P_frac)^{(N-1)/N} * 100
        if P_frac == 0.0:
            Q = 0.0
        else:
            exponent = (N - 1) / N
            Q_frac = P_frac ** exponent
            Q = Q_frac * 100.0
        increase = Q - P
        # To handle negative increases (though with P <=99 and N>=2, likely increase >=0)
        print(f"Case #{tc}: {increase:.15f}")
