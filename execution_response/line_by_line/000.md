**Key Findings:**

To solve the problem, we need to determine how much the probability \( P \) must be increased so that typing \( N \) lines with the new probability yields the same success rate as typing \( N-1 \) lines with the original probability.

1. **Probability of Success:**
   - **Original Approach:** Typing \( N \) lines with each line having a success probability of \( P \%\). The overall success probability is \( (P/100)^N \).
   - **Alternative Approach:** Typing \( N-1 \) lines with the same success probability \( P \%\). The overall success probability is \( (P/100)^{N-1} \).

2. **Equating Success Probabilities:**
   To find the new probability \( P_{\text{new}} \) such that typing \( N \) lines with \( P_{\text{new}} \% \) has the same success rate as the alternative approach, we set:
   \[
   (P_{\text{new}}/100)^N = (P/100)^{N-1}
   \]
   Solving for \( P_{\text{new}} \):
   \[
   P_{\text{new}} = 100 \times \left( \frac{P}{100} \right)^{\frac{N-1}{N}}
   \]

3. **Determining the Increase in \( P \):**
   The required increase \( \Delta P \) is:
   \[
   \Delta P = P_{\text{new}} - P
   \]

4. **Computational Considerations:**
   - Utilize logarithmic transformation to handle the exponentiation for precision, especially with large \( N \).
   - Ensure that floating-point arithmetic is handled with sufficient precision to meet the error bounds specified in the problem.

The Python implementation below follows this approach, calculating the necessary increase in \( P \) for each test case.

```python
import math
import sys

def main():
    T = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    for case in range(1, T +1):
        N_str, P_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()
        N = int(N_str)
        P = int(P_str)
        p = P /100.0
        if p ==0:
            delta_p =0.0
        else:
            # Compute log(p) * (N-1)/N
            exponent = (N-1)/N
            new_p = math.exp(math.log(p) * exponent) *100
            delta_p = new_p - P
        print(f"Case #{case}: {delta_p}")
            
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
