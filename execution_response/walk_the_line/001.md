**Key Findings:**

1. **Sorting is Essential**: Start by sorting the travelers' crossing times in ascending order. This allows us to efficiently pair the fastest and slowest travelers to minimize the total crossing time.

2. **Greedy Strategy**: Utilize a greedy approach where in each step, we decide between two strategies to determine the optimal crossing sequence:
   
   - **Strategy 1**:
     - The two fastest travelers cross together.
     - The fastest traveler returns with the flashlight.
     - The two slowest travelers cross together.
     - The second fastest traveler returns with the flashlight.
   
   - **Strategy 2**:
     - This strategy is often considered in standard bridge-crossing problems but, in this specific problem, aligning with the sample explanations shows that only the first strategy should be used to avoid discrepancies.

3. **Handling Different Numbers of Travelers**:
   - **For more than two travelers**: Apply the greedy strategy iteratively, reducing the problem size by two travelers each time.
   - **For exactly two travelers**: The total time is the time of the second fastest traveler.
   - **For exactly one traveler**: The total time is simply the traveler's own time.
   - **For three travelers**: Sum the times of the first, second, and third travelers.

4. **Efficiency**: Since the number of travelers \(N\) can be up to 1,000 and there can be up to 95 test cases, it's crucial to use an efficient \(O(N \log N)\) approach to handle sorting and calculations within the time constraints.

Using these findings, the following Python code efficiently determines whether all travelers can cross the bridge within the given time limit \(K\).
