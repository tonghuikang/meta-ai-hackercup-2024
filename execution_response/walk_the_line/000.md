**Key Findings:**

1. **Problem Similarity:** The problem is analogous to the classic bridge crossing problem but with a variation in how crossing times are calculated when two people cross together. Instead of the crossing time being the maximum of the two, it is determined by the person pulling the wheelbarrow.

2. **Sorting for Efficiency:** To optimize the crossing strategy, sort the travelers' crossing times in ascending order. This allows leveraging the fastest travelers to ferry others across efficiently.

3. **Greedy Strategy:** Use a greedy approach inspired by the classic problem. At each step, decide between two options:
   - **Option 1:** 
     - Send the two fastest travelers across.
     - Have the fastest return with the flashlight.
     - Send the two slowest travelers across.
     - Have the second fastest return with the flashlight.
     - **Total Time:** \(2 \times S_1 + S_0 + S_{N-1}\)
   - **Option 2:** 
     - Send the fastest traveler with the slowest traveler.
     - Have the fastest return with the flashlight.
     - Send the fastest traveler with the second slowest traveler.
     - Have the fastest return with the flashlight.
     - **Total Time:** \(2 \times S_0 + S_{N-2} + S_{N-1}\)
   - Choose the option with the lesser total time.

4. **Iterative Process:** Repeat the above steps until all travelers have crossed. For the remaining travelers (when \(N \leq 3\)), handle them directly based on their count.

5. **Efficiency Considerations:** Given the constraints (\(N \leq 1000\) and multiple test cases), ensure the solution is efficient by using sorting and a linear traversal for each test case.

**Python Code:**

```python
def solve_bridge_crossing():
    import sys
    import math
    T = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    for test_case in range(1, T+1):
        N, K = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
        S = []
        for _ in range(N):
            S.append(int(sys.stdin.readline()))
        S.sort()
        total_time = 0
        left = N
        i = N - 1
        while left > 0:
            if left ==1:
                total_time += S[0]
                left -=1
            elif left ==2:
                total_time += S[1]
                left -=2
            elif left ==3:
                total_time += S[0] + S[1] + S[2]
                left -=3
            else:
                option1 = 2 * S[1] + S[0] + S[i]
                option2 = 2 * S[0] + S[i-1] + S[i]
                if option1 < option2:
                    total_time += option1
                else:
                    total_time += option2
                left -=2
                i -=2
        if total_time <= K:
            result = "YES"
        else:
            result = "NO"
        print(f"Case #{test_case}: {result}")
