To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum guaranteed amount of treasure that the captain can collect when starting at each island `S` and making at most `K` stops. The challenge is that the rivers carry the ship downstream randomly (from the captain's perspective), and we need to plan for the worst possible path.

Key Findings:

1. **Minimal Path Strategy**: For each starting island `S`, the worst-case scenario is that the river takes the captain along the path with the minimal total treasure downstream from `S`. This is because we're looking to maximize the minimum guaranteed treasure, so we need to plan for the path that offers the least treasure.

2. **Collecting K Largest Treasures Along Minimal Path**: Along this minimal path, the captain should collect the `K` largest treasures to maximize their minimal guaranteed amount.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: We can define a dynamic programming function `dp[u][k]`, where `dp[u][k]` is the minimal guaranteed total treasure starting from node `u` with at most `k` collects. The recurrence is:
   - If the captain stops at the current island (`u`):
     ```
     dp[u][k] = min(dp[child][k-1] for child in children[u]) + treasure[u]
     ```
   - If the captain doesn't stop at `u`:
     ```
     dp[u][k] = min(dp[child][k] for child in children[u])
     ```
   - The captain will choose the option that maximizes the minimum guaranteed treasure (since he's planning for the worst case).

4. **Optimizing the DP**: To avoid an O(N*M) time complexity (where N is the number of islands and M is the maximum K), we observe that each `dp[u][k]` function per node `u` is a piecewise constant function that changes at most twice. This allows us to process each node in O(log M) time, resulting in an overall time complexity of O(N log N).

Here is the Python code implementing the above strategy:

        A = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
        adj = [[] for _ in range(N)]
        for _ in range(N - 1):
            U, V = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
            U -= 1
            V -= 1
            adj[U].append(V)

                total_sum = (total_sum + sum_K) % MOD

        print(f"Case #{case_num}: {total_sum}")
