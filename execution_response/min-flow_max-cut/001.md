To solve this problem efficiently, we can leverage the structure of the river network, which forms a rooted tree with island 1 at the root. The key idea is to decompose the tree into worst-case paths, also known as minimal paths, based on the worst decisions the adversary could make to minimize our treasure collection.

Here's the high-level approach:

1. **Identify Worst-Case Paths**:
   - For each node, we recursively select the child with the minimal `A_i` (treasure) value to form the worst-case path.
   - This process partitions the tree into several non-overlapping paths where each node proceeds to its worst child.

2. **Compute Cumulative Sums Along Paths**:
   - For each worst-case path, we compute the cumulative sums of treasures along the path.
   - We store the path ID and the position of each node within its path.

3. **Calculate F(S, K)**:
   - For each starting node `S` and for each `K`, we calculate `F(S, K)` as the sum of the first `K` treasures along the worst-case path starting from `S`.
   - This can be efficiently done using the precomputed cumulative sums.

4. **Sum Up the Results**:
   - We sum up all `F(S, K)` for all nodes `S` and all `K` from `1` to `M`.
   - Finally, output the total sum modulo `998,244,353` as per the problem statement.

The implementation ensures an efficient computation by avoiding the need to store large arrays for each node and by reusing computations wherever possible.

Here's the complete Python code implementing the above approach:

        for _ in range(N - 1):

**Key Findings When Solving the Problem**:

- The river network forms a tree rooted at island 1 due to the unidirectional rivers.
- The worst-case path from any node is determined by always choosing the child with the minimal treasure value.
- By partitioning the tree into worst-case paths, we can efficiently compute cumulative sums along these paths.
- Overlapping paths can be handled by keeping track of path IDs and positions, allowing reuse of computations.
- The cumulative sums enable us to calculate `F(S, K)` for any `K` without redundant computations, ensuring an efficient algorithm within the constraints.

This approach ensures that the solution runs efficiently within the given constraints and correctly computes the required sums for `F(S, K)`.
