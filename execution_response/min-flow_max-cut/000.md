When solving this problem, the key insights are as follows:

1. **Tree Structure**: The islands form a directed tree rooted at island 1. Each island can have multiple downstream islands.

2. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Approach**: We define `F(S, K)` as the maximum guaranteed sum of treasures you can collect starting from island `S` with at most `K` stops. The recurrence relation for `F(S, K)` is:
   \[
   F(S, K) = \max\left(A_S + \min_{c \in \text{children of } S} F(c, K-1),\ \min_{c \in \text{children of } S} F(c, K)\right)
   \]
   - **Collect at `S`**: If you choose to collect treasure at island `S`, you add `A_S` to the minimal `F(c, K-1)` among all children.
   - **Don't Collect at `S`**: If you choose not to collect at `S`, you take the minimal `F(c, K)` among all children.

3. **Optimization**: Directly computing `F(S, K)` for all nodes and all `K` up to `M` would be computationally expensive given the constraints. To optimize:
   - **Preprocessing**: Process the tree in a bottom-up manner (post-order traversal).
   - **Monotonicity**: Utilize the fact that `F(S, K)` is non-decreasing with respect to `K`. This allows for efficient computation by identifying thresholds where decisions to collect at `S` change.

4. **Summation**: After computing `F(S, K)` for all relevant `S` and `K`, sum these values and take the result modulo `998244353` as required.

Given the complexity, the implementation below uses memoization and efficient traversal to compute the required sums while adhering to the problem's constraints.
