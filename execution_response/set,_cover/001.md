To solve the problem, we need to find the largest rectangle in the grid that contains no '0's and at most \(K\) '?'s (which can be turned into '1's). This rectangle can be thought of as consisting of '1's and up to \(K\) '?'s.

Here are the key findings and steps to solve the problem:

1. **Transform the Problem**:
   - The grid consists of '1's, '0's, and '?'. We can think of '1's and '?'s as usable cells, and '0's as obstacles.
   - We need to find the largest rectangle containing only usable cells and at most \(K\) '?'s.

2. **Use Histogram Method for Maximal Rectangle**:
   - The classic problem of finding the largest rectangle of '1's in a binary matrix can be solved using the histogram method.
   - For each row, we can consider it as the base of a histogram where the height of each bar is the number of consecutive usable (non-'0') cells above it.

3. **Modify the Histogram Method to Account for '?'s**:
   - Instead of just the height, we need to keep track of the cumulative number of '?'s in the rectangle.
   - When pushing and popping from the stack in the histogram method, keep track of cumulative counts of '?'s.

4. **Algorithm Steps**:
   - For each row:
     - Calculate `h[j]`, the height of the consecutive usable cells above cell `(i, j)`.
     - Calculate `q[j]`, the cumulative number of '?'s in the column up to the current row.
   - Use a stack to process the histogram per row, keeping track of cumulative counts of '?'s.
     - When popping from the stack, aggregate cumulative '?' counts and calculate area if the count is within \(K\).
   - Record the maximum area found that satisfies the '?'s constraint.

5. **Time Complexity Optimization**:
   - The modified histogram method runs in \(O(N^2)\) time, which is acceptable since \(N \leq 2500\).

6. **Implementation Tips**:
   - Use a data structure (like a named tuple or class) to store elements in the stack with their positions, heights, and cumulative '?' counts.
   - Be careful with indices to prevent off-by-one errors.
   - Test the implementation with provided samples to ensure correctness.

Here's the Python code implementing the above solution:

```python

    import threading
    sys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)
    T = int(stdin.readline())
    for test_case in range(1, T + 1):
        N, K = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
        grid = []
        for _ in range(N):
            grid.append(stdin.readline().strip())
        N_cols = len(grid[0])

        h = [0] * N_cols
        q = [0] * N_cols
        max_area = 0

        for i in range(N):
            stack = []
            for j in range(N_cols):
                if grid[i][j] == '0':
                    h[j] = 0
                    q[j] = 0
                else:

            stack = []
            while j < N_cols:
                if not stack or h[j] >= stack[-1][1]:
                    # Push current bar onto stack
                    cumulative_q = q[j]
                    pos = j
                    stack.append([pos, h[j], cumulative_q])
                    j += 1
                else:

                    cum_q = last[2]
                    # Determine width
                    width = j - pos
                    # Compute cumulative '?' count
                    # cum_q already includes cumulative '?'s in the rectangle
                    if cum_q <= K:

                        max_area = max(max_area, area)
                    # Update cumulative_q for next rectangle
                    if stack:
                        stack[-1][2] += cum_q
            while stack:

                pos = last[0]
                height = last[1]
                cum_q = last[2]
                width = N_cols - pos
                if cum_q <= K:
                    area = height * width
                    max_area = max(max_area, area)
