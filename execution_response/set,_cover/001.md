To solve this problem efficiently, we need to maximize the area of the rectangle covering all the '1's in the grid after converting exactly \( K \) '?' cells to '1's. Here are the key findings and the approach:

**Key Findings:**

1. **Rectangle Area Determination:**
   - The area of the rectangle covering all '1's is determined by the minimum and maximum row and column indices of the '1's, i.e., \( \text{area} = (\text{max\_row} - \text{min\_row} + 1) \times (\text{max\_col} - \text{min\_col} + 1) \).

2. **Possible Expansions:**
   - We can expand the rectangle by including '?' cells that are outside the current bounds of the rectangle. Each expansion can either decrease the minimum row/column or increase the maximum row/column.

3. **Area Increase per Expansion:**
   - Expanding upwards or downwards (changing rows) increases the area by the current width (\( \Delta_\text{col} \)).
   - Expanding leftwards or rightwards (changing columns) increases the area by the current height (\( \Delta_\text{row} \)).

4. **Greedy Approach:**
   - At each step, we should choose the expansion that offers the maximum area increase per unit 'K' spent. This is equivalent to choosing the direction (up, down, left, right) that gives the most significant area gain.

5. **Implementation Strategy:**
   - Build four lists of possible expansions in each direction, sorted appropriately.
   - Use pointers to iterate through these lists, selecting expansions based on the area gain at each step.
   - Update \( \Delta_\text{row} \) and \( \Delta_\text{col} \) after each expansion since they affect the area gains of subsequent expansions.

6. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - If there are no initial '1's, we must use one 'K' to set any '?' to '1' to start forming a rectangle.
   - We need to handle cases where expansions are not possible due to the absence of '?' cells in specific rows or columns.

**Explanation of the Code:**

- We read the input and collect positions of '1's and '?'s in the grid.
- Initialize the rectangle covering the '1's. If there are no '1's, we select any '?' position to start, decreasing \( K \) by 1.
- Build four lists for possible expansions in each direction:
  - `min_row_list`: Rows above the current minimum row with '?', sorted in ascending order.
  - `max_row_list`: Rows below the current maximum row with '?', sorted in descending order.
  - `min_col_list`: Columns to the left of the current minimum column with '?', sorted in ascending order.
  - `max_col_list`: Columns to the right of the current maximum column with '?', sorted in descending order.
- Use pointers (`min_row_ptr`, `max_row_ptr`, etc.) to keep track of expansions in each direction.
- While we have \( K \) left, we:
  - Calculate the potential area increase for each possible expansion.
  - Choose the expansion with the maximum area increase per unit \( K \) spent.
  - Update the rectangle bounds and \( \Delta_\text{row} \) or \( \Delta_\text{col} \) accordingly.
- After all expansions are done or \( K \) is exhausted, we calculate the final area.

**Note:** We use threading to avoid exceeding the recursion limit in some environments due to the large input size, and we increase the recursion limit at the start of `main()`.
