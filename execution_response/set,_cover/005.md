To solve this problem, we need to maximize the area of the smallest rectangle (cover) that contains all '1's in the grid after changing exactly \(K\) '?'s to '1's. 

**Approach Overview:**

- **Initial Rectangle**: Determine the minimal rectangle that currently contains all the '1's.
- **Possible Expansions**: In order to maximize the area, we can expand this rectangle in four directions: up, down, left, and right by turning '?'s into '1's as required.
- **Benefit per Cost**: For each possible expansion, calculate:
  - **Cost**: The number of '?'s that need to be converted to '1's to expand in that direction by one unit.
  - **Benefit**: The increase in area achieved by this expansion.
- **Greedy Algorithm**: Implement a greedy strategy that always selects the expansion with the highest benefit per cost ratio until we either run out of '?'s to convert (i.e., total cost exceeds \(K\)) or no further expansion is possible.
  
**Implementation Details:**

- We use a min-heap to efficiently select the next best expansion based on the highest benefit per cost ratio.
- Each expansion has attributes: direction, position, cost, benefit, and the updated benefit per cost ratio.
- After each expansion, the potential expansions in the same direction get updated because the dimensions of the rectangle change, affecting both cost and benefit.

**Instructions in the Code:**

1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of test cases and processes each grid.
2. **Identifying Initial Rectangle**: It scans the grid to find all positions of '1's to define the initial cover rectangle.
3. **Handling No '1's in Grid**: If there are no '1's, but \(K \geq 1\), it picks the best '?' to convert, which is the one that gives the maximum area.
4. **Preparation for Greedy Expansion**:
   - Initialize variables to keep track of the current rectangle boundaries.
   - Compute initial costs and benefits for possible expansions in all four directions.
   - Build a min-heap to store and process potential expansions efficiently.
5. **Greedy Expansion Process**:
   - Repeatedly select and apply the expansion with the highest benefit per cost.
   - After each expansion, update the rectangle boundaries and total cost.
   - If the total cost exceeds \(K\), the process stops.
6. **Output**: For each test case, output the maximal area achieved after the expansion process.
