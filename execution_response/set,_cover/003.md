**Key Findings:**

1. **Objective:** To maximize the area of the smallest rectangle (cover) that contains all `1`s in an \( N \times N \) grid by setting exactly \( K \) `?` cells to `1`.

2. **Initial Coverage:** Start by identifying the existing `1`s in the grid to determine the initial minimum and maximum rows and columns (`min_row`, `max_row`, `min_col`, `max_col`). The initial cover area is calculated as \((\text{max\_row} - \text{min\_row} + 1) \times (\text{max\_col} - \text{min\_col} + 1)\).

3. **Maximizing Area:** To maximize the cover area, we need to expand the boundaries:
   - **Top Boundary:** Set `1`s in the topmost possible rows.
   - **Bottom Boundary:** Set `1`s in the bottommost possible rows.
   - **Left Boundary:** Set `1`s in the leftmost possible columns.
   - **Right Boundary:** Set `1`s in the rightmost possible columns.

4. **Strategic Placement:** 
   - Prioritize setting `1`s in rows and columns that can most significantly expand the current boundaries.
   - Use a greedy approach to choose positions that contribute to expanding either the row or column boundaries with the least cost in terms of the number of `?`s used.
   
5. **Efficient Selection:** 
   - Preprocess the grid to identify potential candidates for setting `1`s in rows and columns that can help in expanding the boundaries.
   - Use combinations of row and column expansions that fit within the allowed \( K \) `1`s to maximize the area.

6. **Optimization Considerations:** 
   - Due to the large size of \( N \) (up to 2500) and multiple test cases, the solution must be optimized to run efficiently, potentially using prefix sums or other optimization techniques to avoid redundant computations.

7. **Edge Cases:** 
   - If there are already `1`s covering the entire grid, the maximum area is \( N \times N \).
   - If \( K = 0 \), the area is determined solely by the existing `1`s.

Based on these findings, the following Python code implements an efficient solution to compute the maximum possible cover area for each test case.
