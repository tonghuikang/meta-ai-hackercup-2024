**Key Findings:**

1. **Initial Cover Calculation:**
   - Identify the minimum and maximum rows (`min_row`, `max_row`) and columns (`min_col`, `max_col`) that contain `1`s in the initial grid.
   - The initial cover area is computed as `(max_row - min_row + 1) * (max_col - min_col + 1)`.

2. **Potential Extensions:**
   - To maximize the cover area, we aim to expand the current rectangle by setting `1`s in `?` cells that extend the boundaries (top, bottom, left, right).
   - Each extension (e.g., expanding the top boundary upwards) requires setting at least one `1` in the new row or column.

3. **Optimization Strategy:**
   - Determine the number of extensions possible in each direction (up, down, left, right) based on the availability of `?` cells.
   - Use binary search or greedy methods to find the maximum possible area by allocating `K` transformations optimally across extensions.
   - Precompute for each potential new boundary how many `?` cells need to be set to `1` to achieve that extension.

4. **Efficient Computation:**
   - Given the large possible size of `N` (up to 2500), it's crucial to compute row and column extensions efficiently.
   - Utilize prefix sums or cumulative counts to quickly determine the number of `?` cells in any given row or column.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - If there are no initial `1`s, selecting any `K` `?` cells to form the largest possible rectangle.
   - Ensuring that the cover always includes at least one `1` after setting `K` cells.
