**Key Findings:**

1. **Definition of a Peak:**
   - A peak number has an odd number of digits (\(2k + 1\) digits).
   - All digits are non-zero.
   - The digits first increase by 1 up to the middle digit and then decrease by 1.
   
2. **Generation of Peak Numbers:**
   - Single-digit numbers (1-9) are inherently peaks.
   - For multi-digit peaks:
     - Choose a value of \(k\) such that \(2k + 1\) does not exceed 19 (since \(B \leq 10^{18}\)).
     - The starting digit \(d\) must be chosen such that increasing by \(k\) steps does not exceed 9. Therefore, \(d\) can range from 1 to \(9 - k\).
     - Construct the first \(k + 1\) digits by incrementing the starting digit.
     - Mirror these digits in reverse (excluding the middle digit) to form the full peak number.
   
3. **Handling Large Ranges and Multiple Test Cases:**
   - Pre-generate all possible peak numbers within the range of \(1\) to \(10^{19}\).
   - For each test case:
     - Use binary search (via the `bisect` module) to efficiently find peaks within the range \([A, B]\).
     - Count how many of these peaks are divisible by \(M\).
   
4. **Efficiency Considerations:**
   - Since the number of possible peak numbers is limited (given the constraints), pre-generating them ensures that each test case can be processed quickly.
   - Utilizing binary search optimizes the retrieval of relevant peaks for each range query.

**Python Code:**

```python
import sys
import bisect

def generate_peaks():
    peaks = []
    # Single-digit peaks
    for d in range(1, 10):
        peaks.append(d)
    # Multi-digit peaks
    for k in range(1, 10):  # k from 1 to 9, since 2*9 +1 =19 digits
        num_digits = 2 * k + 1
        for start in range(1, 10 - k):
            # Build first k+1 digits
            first_part = [start + i for i in range(k + 1)]
            # Verify no digit exceeds 9
            if first_part[-1] > 9:
                continue
            # Build the full peak by appending the decreasing part
            full_digits = first_part + [first_part[-2 - i] for i in range(k)]
            # Convert digits to number
            peak = 0
            for d in full_digits:
                if d == 0:
                    break  # Skip if any digit is zero
                peak = peak * 10 + d
            else:
                peaks.append(peak)
    peaks.sort()
    return peaks

        M = int(input[ptr + 2])
