**Key Findings:**

1. **Peak Generation**:
   - A peak number has an odd number of digits, specifically \(2k + 1\) digits.
   - The first \(k+1\) digits increment by 1, and the last \(k+1\) digits decrement by 1.
   - For each possible \(k\) (from 0 to 8, since \(2k+1 \leq 17\) for numbers up to \(10^{18}\)), generate all valid peaks by selecting the starting digit \(D_1\) from 1 to \(9 - k\).
   
2. **Precomputation**:
   - There are only 45 possible peaks (sum of 9 for \(k=0\) to 1 for \(k=8\)), making it feasible to precompute and store all peak numbers.
   
3. **Handling Test Cases**:
   - For each test case, iterate through the precomputed list of peaks.
   - Count the number of peaks that fall within the given range \([A, B]\) and are divisible by \(M\).
   
4. **Edge Cases**:
   - Single-digit peaks (\(k=0\)) range from 1 to 9.
   - Ensure that no digits are zero and handle the special case when \(A = 0\).

**Python Code:**

```python
def generate_peaks():
    peaks = []
    for k in range(0, 9):  # k from 0 to 8, since 2*8+1=17 digits
        num_digits = 2 * k + 1
        if num_digits > 18:
            continue  # since B can be up to 10^18
        max_start = 9 - k
        for D1 in range(1, max_start +1):
            digits = []
            # Ascending part
            for i in range(k +1):
                digit = D1 + i
                if digit >9:
                    break
                digits.append(str(digit))
            else:
                # Descending part
                for i in range(k):
                    digit = digits[-1] -1
                    if digit <1:
                        break
                    digits.append(str(digit))
                else:
                    peak_num = int("".join(digits))
                    peaks.append(peak_num)
    peaks_sorted = sorted(peaks)
    return peaks_sorted
