**Key Findings:**

1. **Peak Definition and Constraints:**
   - A peak is a number with an odd number of digits \(2k + 1\) where \(k \geq 0\).
   - All digits are non-zero.
   - The first \(k+1\) digits increase by 1 sequentially.
   - The last \(k+1\) digits decrease by 1 sequentially.
   - Given the maximum value of \(B\) as \(10^{18}\), the maximum number of digits for a peak is 19, implying \(k\) can range from 0 to 8.

2. **Precomputation Strategy:**
   - Since the total number of potential peaks is small (45 peaks for \(k\) from 0 to 8), we can precompute all possible peaks.
   - For each valid \(k\), generate peaks by selecting appropriate starting digits \(D1\) such that all digits remain between 1 and 9.
   - Each peak is constructed by first incrementing from \(D1\) to \(D1 + k\) and then decrementing back to \(D1\).

3. **Efficient Counting:**
   - After precomputing and sorting all possible peaks, for each test case, iterate through this list.
   - Count the number of peaks that fall within the range \([A, B]\) and are divisible by \(M\).
   - This approach is efficient due to the small fixed size of the precomputed peak list.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - Handle cases where \(A = 0\) by ensuring that only peaks \(\geq 1\) are considered.
   - Ensure single-digit peaks are correctly identified when \(k = 0\).

**Python Code:**

```python
def main():
    import sys

    # Precompute all possible peaks
    peaks = []
    for k in range(0, 9):  # k from 0 to 8
        for D1 in range(1, 10 - k):
            # Generate first k+1 digits increasing by 1
            increasing = [D1 + i for i in range(0, k + 1)]
            # Generate last k digits decreasing by 1
            decreasing = [D1 + k - i -1 for i in range(0, k)]
            digits = increasing + decreasing
            # Convert digits to integer
            p = int(''.join(str(d) for d in digits))
            peaks.append(p)
    # Sort the peaks
    peaks = sorted(peaks)
    
    # Read input
    input = sys.stdin.read().split()
    T = int(input[0])
    ptr =1
    for test_case in range(1, T +1):
        A = int(input[ptr])
        B = int(input[ptr +1])
        M = int(input[ptr +2])
        ptr +=3
        count =0
        for p in peaks:
            if A <= p <=B:
                if p % M ==0:
                    count +=1
            elif p > B:
                break  # since peaks are sorted, no need to check further
        print(f"Case #{test_case}: {count}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
