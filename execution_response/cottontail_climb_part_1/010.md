**Key Findings:**

1. **Peak Structure:** A peak number has an odd number of digits \(2k + 1\), where the first \(k+1\) digits strictly increase by 1, and the last \(k+1\) digits strictly decrease by 1. All digits are non-zero.

2. **Generation of Peaks:** 
   - Iterate over possible values of \(k\) (from 0 to 8, since \(2k + 1 \leq 17\) for numbers up to \(10^{18}\)).
   - For each \(k\), determine the valid starting digits \(D_1\) such that \(D_1 + k \leq 9\) to ensure no digit exceeds 9.
   - Construct the peak by first increasing the digits and then decreasing them.

3. **Precomputation:** Since the total number of possible peaks is relatively small (given the constraints), it's efficient to precompute all possible peak numbers and sort them for quick access during test cases.

4. **Handling Multiple Test Cases:** 
   - For each test case, use binary search to find all peaks within the range \([A, B]\).
   - Count how many of these peaks are divisible by \(M\).

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - Single-digit numbers (\(k=0\)) are considered peaks.
   - Ensure that numbers like 0 are handled correctly (although peaks must have non-zero digits).

**Python Code:**

```python
import sys
import bisect

def generate_peaks():
    peaks = set()
    # k from 0 to 8 (since 2*8+1=17 digits)
    for k in range(0, 9):
        max_start_digit = 9 - k  # Ensure D1 + k <=9
        for D1 in range(1, max_start_digit +1):
            # Build increasing part
            increasing = [D1 + i for i in range(0, k+1)]
            # Build decreasing part
            decreasing = [increasing[-2 -i] for i in range(0, k)] if k >0 else []
            full_number_digits = increasing + decreasing
            # Check all digits are non-zero (already ensured by D1 >=1 and D1 +k <=9)
            number = int(''.join(map(str, full_number_digits)))
            peaks.add(number)
    # Also include single-digit peaks (k=0, already included)
    return sorted(peaks)

def main():
    peaks = generate_peaks()
    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()
    T = int(input[0])
    for test_case in range(1, T+1):
        A_str, B_str, M_str = input[test_case].strip().split()
        A = int(A_str)
        B = int(B_str)
        M = int(M_str)
        # Find the indices where peaks >= A and peaks <= B
        left = bisect.bisect_left(peaks, A)
        right = bisect.bisect_right(peaks, B)
        count = 0
        for num in peaks[left:right]:
            if num % M ==0:
                count +=1
        print(f"Case #{test_case}: {count}")
