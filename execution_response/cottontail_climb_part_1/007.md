**Key Findings:**

1. **Understanding Peak Structure:**
   - A peak number has an odd number of digits, specifically \(2k + 1\) digits.
   - The digits increase by 1 for the first \(k+1\) digits and then decrease by 1 for the last \(k+1\) digits.
   - All digits must be non-zero, limiting the possible range of digits to 1-9.

2. **Generating Peaks:**
   - To generate all possible peak numbers, iterate over possible values of \(k\) such that \(2k + 1\) does not exceed the maximum number of digits in \(B\) (up to 19 digits for \(10^{18}\)).
   - For each \(k\), determine the valid starting digits that allow the sequence to increase and then decrease without exceeding the digit limit (i.e., digits must remain between 1 and 9).

3. **Efficiency Considerations:**
   - Precompute all possible peak numbers within the range \([1, 10^{18}]\) since the number of possible peaks is relatively small (on the order of hundreds).
   - Once the list of peaks is generated, sort it to enable efficient range queries using binary search for each test case.

4. **Handling Large Inputs:**
   - Given the constraints (\(A\) and \(B\) up to \(10^{18}\) and \(T\) up to 100), precomputing and sorting peaks ensures that each test case can be processed quickly.
   - Utilize efficient modulo operations to count peaks that are multiples of \(M\).

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - Single-digit peaks (\(k=0\)) are simply the digits 1 through 9.
   - Ensure that peaks do not contain any zeros, as per the problem statement.
   - Handle cases where \(A\) or \(B\) fall exactly on a peak number.

**Python Code:**

        length = 2 * k + 1
        if length > 19:
            continue
        # The starting digit ranges from 1 to 9 - k
        for start in range(1, 10):
            # Check if the increasing sequence is possible

            for _ in range(k):
