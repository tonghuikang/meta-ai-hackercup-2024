To solve this problem, it's crucial to recognize that the number of possible "peak" numbers is limited due to their specific structure and the constraints on their digits. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the key findings and approach:

1. **Understanding Peak Numbers**:
   - A peak number has a length of \(2k + 1\) digits for some \(k \geq 0\).
   - Its digits increase by 1 up to a peak digit and then decrease by 1 symmetrically.
   - Digits are from 1 to 9 (non-zero).

2. **Generating All Possible Peaks**:
   - For each possible \(k\) (from 0 to 8, since \(2k + 1 \leq 17\) to stay within \(10^{18}\)):
     - For each starting digit \(D_1\) from 1 to \(9 - k\):
       - Build the ascending part: \(D_i = D_1 + (i - 1)\) for \(i\) from 1 to \(k+1\).
       - Ensure no digit exceeds 9.
       - Create the full number by appending the descending part (mirror of ascending without the peak digit).
       - Convert the list of digits into a number.

3. **Storing Peaks**:
   - Precompute and store all valid peak numbers (total of 45 peaks).

4. **Processing Test Cases**:
   - For each test case, filter the precomputed peaks to find those within the range \([A, B]\) and divisible by \(M\).

5. **Efficiency Considerations**:
   - Precomputing peaks avoids redundant calculations for each test case.
   - The small number of peaks (45) ensures that the solution is efficient within the given constraints.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - Ensure that the generated numbers do not exceed \(10^{18}\).
   - Confirm that the digits remain within 1 to 9 after incrementing.

The final Python code encapsulates this approach:

```python
T = int(input())
peaks = []
# Precompute all possible peaks
for k in range(0, 9):  # k from 0 to 8
    max_D1 = 9 - k
    for D_1 in range(1, max_D1 + 1):
        ascending_digits = [D_1 + i for i in range(k + 1)]
        # Ensure no digit is greater than 9
        if any(d > 9 for d in ascending_digits):
            continue
        descending_digits = ascending_digits[:-1][::-1]
        digits = ascending_digits + descending_digits
        number = int(''.join(map(str, digits)))
        peaks.append(number)

# Process each test case
for case_num in range(1, T + 1):
    A_str = input().strip()
    while A_str == '':
        A_str = input().strip()
    A, B, M = map(int, A_str.strip().split())
    count = 0
    for peak in peaks:
        if A <= peak <= B and peak % M == 0:
            count += 1
    print(f'Case #{case_num}: {count}')
```
