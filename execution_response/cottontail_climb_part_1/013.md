**Key Findings:**

1. **Understanding Peak Definition:**
   - A peak number has \(2k + 1\) digits for some integer \(k \geq 0\).
   - No digit in the number is zero.
   - The first \(k + 1\) digits increment by 1 consecutively.
   - The last \(k + 1\) digits decrement by 1 consecutively.

2. **Generating Peaks:**
   - For each possible \(k\) (from 0 to 9, since \(2k + 1 \leq 19\) for \(k = 9\)):
     - The starting digit (\(D_1\)) can range from 1 to \(9 - k\) to ensure that during the ascent, digits do not exceed 9.
     - Construct the peak by incrementing the digits for the first \(k + 1\) positions and then decrementing for the last \(k + 1\) positions.
   - Since \(k\) ranges from 0 to 9, and for each \(k\), there are \(9 - k\) possible starting digits, the total number of peaks is manageable (45 peaks).

3. **Handling Test Cases Efficiently:**
   - Precompute all possible peaks and store them in a sorted list.
   - For each test case:
     - Use binary search to find the range of peaks that lie within \([A, B]\).
     - Count how many of these peaks are divisible by \(M\).

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - Single-digit peaks (when \(k = 0\)) are valid.
   - Ensure that when \(A = 0\), peaks starting from 1 are considered.
   - Handle large numbers efficiently since peaks can be up to \(10^{19}\).

5. **Efficiency Considerations:**
   - Given the small number of peaks (45), iterating through the list for each test case is efficient.
   - Python's handling of large integers ensures that divisibility checks for large peaks are accurate.

**Python Code:**

```python
import sys
import bisect

def generate_peaks():
    peaks = []
    for k in range(0, 10):  # since 2k+1 <=19 when k<=9
        num_digits = 2 * k +1
        if num_digits > 19:
            continue
        for start in range(1, 10 - k):
            digits = []
            # Ascending part
            for i in range(0, k+1):
                digits.append(str(start + i))
            # Descending part
            for i in range(k-1, -1, -1):
                digits.append(str(start + i))
            peak_num = int(''.join(digits))
            peaks.append(peak_num)
    peaks = sorted(peaks)
    return peaks

def count_peaks(peaks, A, B, M):
    left = bisect.bisect_left(peaks, A)
    right = bisect.bisect_right(peaks, B)
    count = 0
    for i in range(left, right):
        if peaks[i] % M ==0:
            count +=1
    return count

    peaks = generate_peaks()
    T = int(sys.stdin.readline())

        B = int(B_str)
        M = int(M_str)
        cnt = count_peaks(peaks, A, B, M)
