**Key Findings:**

1. **Peak Structure and Constraints:**
   - A peak has an odd number of digits, specifically \(2k + 1\) digits for some integer \(k \geq 0\).
   - No digit in a peak is zero.
   - The digits first increase consecutively by 1 up to the middle digit and then decrease consecutively by 1.
   
2. **Total Number of Peaks:**
   - For each \(k\), the number of possible starting digits \(D_1\) is limited by the condition that digits must remain between 1 and 9.
   - Specifically, \(D_1\) can range from 1 to \(9 - k\) to ensure that \(D_{k+1} = D_1 + k\) does not exceed 9.
   - Summing over all possible \(k\) (from 0 to 8, since \(k=9\) would require \(D_1=0\) which is invalid), there are a total of 45 possible peaks.

3. **Precomputation Strategy:**
   - Given the small total number of peaks (45), it's efficient to precompute and store all possible peaks.
   - This allows for rapid querying within the range \([A, B]\) for each test case.

4. **Handling Test Cases:**
   - For each test case, iterate through the precomputed list of peaks.
   - Count the number of peaks that fall within the range \([A, B]\) and are divisible by \(M\).
   - Utilizing binary search can optimize the retrieval of peaks within the specified range, but given the small dataset, a simple iteration is sufficiently efficient.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - Single-digit numbers are considered peaks.
   - Ensure that all digits are non-zero.
   - Handle the case where no peaks exist within the specified range or none are divisible by \(M\).

**Python Code:**

```python
def generate_peaks():
    peaks = []
    # k from 0 to 9 (since 2*9+1=19 digits, which is the max for 10^18)
    for k in range(0, 10):
        # Starting digit D1 from 1 to 9 - k
        for D1 in range(1, 10 - k):
            # Build the increasing part
            increasing = [D1 + i for i in range(k +1)]
            # Build the decreasing part
            decreasing = [D1 + k - i for i in range(1, k +1)]
            # Combine to form the peak digits
            peak_digits = increasing + decreasing
            # Convert digits to integer
            peak = int(''.join(map(str, peak_digits)))
            peaks.append(peak)
    return sorted(peaks)

def count_peaks_in_range(peaks, A, B, M):
    count = 0
    for p in peaks:
        if A <= p <= B:
            if p % M == 0:
                count +=1
    return count
