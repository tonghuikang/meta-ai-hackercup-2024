**Key Findings:**

1. **Definition of Peaks:**
   - **Digit Length:** A peak must have \(2k + 1\) digits for some integer \(k \geq 0\). This means possible lengths are 1, 3, 5, ..., up to 19 digits (since \(10^{18}\) has 19 digits).
   - **No Zero Digits:** All digits must be non-zero (i.e., digits range from 1 to 9).
   - **Increasing Sequence:** The first \(k+1\) digits must form a strictly increasing sequence where each subsequent digit increases by 1.
   - **Decreasing Sequence:** The last \(k+1\) digits must form a strictly decreasing sequence where each subsequent digit decreases by 1.

2. **Total Number of Peaks:**
   - For each \(k\), the starting digit \(D_1\) can range from 1 to \(9 - k\) to ensure no digit exceeds 9.
   - Summing over all valid \(k\) (from 0 to 9), the total number of possible peaks is relatively small (45 peaks in total).

3. **Approach:**
   - **Precompute Peaks:** Generate all possible peak numbers based on the criteria above.
   - **Filter Peaks for Each Test Case:** For each test case with range \([A, B]\) and divisor \(M\), iterate through the precomputed peaks and count those that lie within the range and are divisible by \(M\).

4. **Edge Cases Considered:**
   - **Single-Digit Peaks:** When \(k = 0\), peaks are single-digit numbers from 1 to 9.
   - **Range Boundaries:** Ensure that when \(A = 0\), it doesn't include zero since peaks cannot have zero digits.
   - **Divisibility by 1:** All peaks are divisible by 1, so when \(M = 1\), all peaks within the range should be counted.

5. **Efficiency:**
   - Since the total number of peaks is small (45), precomputing them and iterating through them for each test case is efficient even with up to 100 test cases.

**Python Code:**

```python
def generate_peaks():
    peaks = set()
    # k = 0: single-digit peaks
    for d in range(1, 10):
        peaks.add(d)
    # k >=1
    for k in range(1, 10):
        num_digits = 2 * k + 1
        for d1 in range(1, 10 - k):
            # Build the first k+1 digits increasing by 1
            digits = [d1 + i for i in range(k + 1)]
            # Build the last k digits decreasing by 1
            digits += [digits[-1] - i for i in range(1, k +1)]
            # Check all digits are between 1 and 9
            if all(1 <= d <=9 for d in digits):
                # Convert digits to number
                num = 0
                for d in digits:
                    num = num *10 + d
                peaks.add(num)
    return sorted(peaks)

        B = int(B_str)
        M = int(M_str)
        count = 0
        for peak in peaks:
            if A <= peak <= B:
                if peak % M ==0:
                    count +=1
        print(f"Case #{case}: {count}")
