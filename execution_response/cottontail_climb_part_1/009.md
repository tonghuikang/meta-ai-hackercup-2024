**Key Findings:**

1. **Understanding Peaks:**
   - A peak number has an odd number of digits \(2k + 1\), where \(k \geq 0\).
   - All digits are non-zero.
   - The first \(k + 1\) digits are strictly increasing by 1.
   - The last \(k + 1\) digits are strictly decreasing by 1.
   
2. **Generating Peak Numbers:**
   - Iterate over possible values of \(k\) (from 0 to 8, since \(2 \times 8 + 1 = 17\) digits is within the constraint \(10^{18}\)).
   - For each \(k\), the starting digit \(D_1\) can range from 1 to \(9 - k\) to ensure all digits remain between 1 and 9.
   - Construct the peak number by first creating the increasing sequence and then the decreasing sequence.
   
3. **Precomputing Peaks:**
   - Since the total number of peak numbers is limited (45 in total), precompute all possible peak numbers and store them in a sorted list.
   
4. **Processing Test Cases:**
   - For each test case, iterate through the precomputed peaks and count those that fall within the specified range \([A, B]\) and are divisible by \(M\).
   - Utilize Python's efficient handling of large integers to manage numbers up to \(10^{18}\).

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - Ensure that single-digit peak numbers (where \(k = 0\)) are correctly handled.
   - Handle cases where \(A\) is 0, even though the smallest peak is 1.

**Python Code:**

```python
def generate_peaks():
    peaks = []
    for k in range(0, 9):  # k from 0 to 8
        max_start = 9 - k
        for D1 in range(1, max_start +1):
            # First k+1 digits: D1 to D1+k
            increasing = [D1 + i for i in range(0, k+1)]
            # Last k digits: D1+k-1 down to D1
            decreasing = [D1 + k - i for i in range(1, k+1)]
            digits = increasing + decreasing
            number = int(''.join(map(str, digits)))
            peaks.append(number)
    peaks = sorted(peaks)
    return peaks

        count = 0
