**Key Findings:**

1. **Peak Definition Simplification:**
   - A peak number must have an odd number of digits \(2k + 1\) where \(k \geq 0\).
   - All digits are non-zero.
   - The first \(k+1\) digits increment by 1.
   - The last \(k+1\) digits decrement by 1.
   
2. **Total Number of Peaks:**
   - For each \(k\) from 0 to 8 (since \(2k + 1 \leq 19\) and \(B \leq 10^{18}\)), there are \(9 - k\) possible starting digits (from 1 to \(9 - k\)).
   - The total number of peaks is small (45), making it feasible to precompute all possible peaks.

3. **Generating Peaks:**
   - Iterate through all valid \(k\) values and starting digits to construct peak numbers.
   - Ensure that none of the digits are zero and that the digits increment and then decrement correctly.

4. **Handling Test Cases:**
   - Precompute and store all possible peaks.
   - For each test case, filter the precomputed peaks that lie within the range \([A, B]\) and are divisible by \(M\).
   - Count and output the number of such peaks for each test case.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - When \(A = 0\), ensure that single-digit peaks (1-9) are considered.
   - Ensure that peaks do not include any digit '0'.

**Python Code:**

```python
def generate_peaks():
    peaks = []
    for k in range(0, 9):  # k from 0 to 8 since 2*8+1=17 digits
        max_start = 9 - k
        for s in range(1, max_start + 1):
            # Build the first k+1 digits increasing by 1
            inc_part = [s + i for i in range(k + 1)]
            # Ensure all digits are <=9
            if inc_part[-1] > 9:
                continue
            # Build the decreasing part
            dec_part = inc_part[-2::-1]  # Exclude the peak digit
            full_number_digits = inc_part + dec_part
            # Check for any zero digits
            if 0 in full_number_digits:
                continue
            # Convert to integer
            num = int(''.join(map(str, full_number_digits)))
            peaks.append(num)
    # Also include single-digit peaks (k=0)
    single_digit_peaks = list(range(1, 10))
    peaks = list(set(peaks + single_digit_peaks))
    peaks.sort()
    return peaks
