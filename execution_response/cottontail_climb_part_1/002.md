**Key Findings:**

1. **Limited Number of Peaks:**
   - Peak numbers are defined as numbers with \(2k + 1\) digits where \(k \geq 0\).
   - For each \(k\), the starting digit can range from 1 to \(9 - k\) to ensure all digits remain non-zero and within 1-9.
   - The total number of possible peaks is relatively small (up to 45 peaks), making it feasible to precompute all peak numbers.

2. **Precomputation Strategy:**
   - Precompute all possible peak numbers by iterating through valid values of \(k\) and valid starting digits.
   - Construct each peak by first incrementing digits and then decrementing them appropriately to form the peak shape.

3. **Efficient Query Handling:**
   - Since the number of peaks is small, for each test case, iterate through the precomputed list of peaks.
   - Count the number of peaks within the given range \([A, B]\) that are divisible by \(M\).

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - Handle cases where \(A = 0\) by ensuring that peaks start from 1.
   - Ensure that all digits in the peak are non-zero.
   - Consider the smallest possible peaks (single-digit numbers) and the largest possible peaks (up to 19 digits).

5. **Implementation Considerations:**
   - Precompute and sort all peak numbers for efficient querying.
   - Utilize Python's built-in functions for handling large integers and efficient filtering.

**Python Code:**

```python
def generate_peaks():
    peaks = []
    # k from 0 to 9 (since 2*9+1=19 digits)
    for k in range(0, 10):
        max_start = 9 - k
        for start in range(1, max_start +1):
            digits = []
            # Increasing part
            for i in range(k+1):
                digit = start + i
                if digit >9:
                    break
                digits.append(str(digit))
            else:
                # Decreasing part
                for i in range(1, k+1):
                    digit = start +k -i
                    if digit <1:
                        break
                    digits.append(str(digit))
                else:
                    # Successfully constructed all digits
                    number = int(''.join(digits))
                    peaks.append(number)
    return sorted(peaks)

def count_peaks(peaks, A, B, M):
    count =0
    for peak in peaks:
        if A <= peak <=B and peak % M ==0:
            count +=1
    return count

    import sys

    peaks = generate_peaks()
    T = int(sys.stdin.readline())

        A_str, B_str, M_str = line.strip().split()

        B = int(B_str)
        M = int(M_str)
        cnt = count_peaks(peaks, A, B, M)
        print(f"Case #{case}: {cnt}")
