**Key Findings:**

1. **Definition of Peaks:** 
   - A peak has \(2k + 1\) digits for some integer \(k \geq 0\).
   - No digits are zero.
   - The first \(k+1\) digits strictly increase by 1.
   - The last \(k+1\) digits strictly decrease by 1.

2. **Total Number of Peaks:**
   - For each \(k\), the number of possible starting digits \(D_1\) is \(9 - k\) because the digits must not exceed 9.
   - Summing over \(k\) from 0 to 8 (since for \(k = 9\), there are no valid \(D_1\)), the total number of peaks is \(9 + 8 + ... + 1 = 45\).

3. **Efficient Enumeration:**
   - Precompute all possible peaks (45 in total) and store them in a sorted list.
   - For each test case, iterate through the precomputed peaks and count those that fall within the range \([A, B]\) and are divisible by \(M\).

4. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - For \(k = 0\), the peaks are single-digit numbers from 1 to 9.
   - Ensure that the generated peaks do not contain any zeros.
   - Account for ranges where \(A = 0\), but peaks start from 1.

Given the small number of possible peaks, this approach is efficient and well within the problem's constraints.

```python
def generate_peaks():
    peaks = []
    for k in range(0, 10):  # since 2k+1 <=19 when k<=9
        N = 2 * k + 1
        max_D1 = 9 - k
        if max_D1 < 1:
            continue
        for D1 in range(1, max_D1 +1):
            # Generate up part
            up = [D1 + i for i in range(k +1)]
            # Check if all digits are <=9
            if up[-1] >9:
                continue
            # Generate down part
            down = [up[-2 -i] for i in range(k)] if k >0 else []
            digits = up + down
            # Ensure no digit is zero and all digits are between1 and9
            if any(d <1 or d >9 for d in digits):
                continue
            # Convert digits to number
            num = int(''.join(map(str,digits)))
            peaks.append(num)
    peaks.sort()
    return peaks
