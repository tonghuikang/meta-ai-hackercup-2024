**Key Findings:**

1. **Peak Definition and Constraints:**
   - A peak number has \(2k + 1\) digits for some integer \(k \geq 0\).
   - All digits are non-zero.
   - The first \(k+1\) digits strictly increase by 1.
   - The last \(k+1\) digits strictly decrease by 1.
   - Given the maximum digit length of \(19\) (since \(2k + 1 \leq 19\) for \(k \leq 9\)), we limit \(k\) from \(0\) to \(9\).

2. **Generating Peak Numbers:**
   - For each \(k\) from \(0\) to \(9\), determine valid starting digits \(D1\) such that \(D1 + k \leq 9\) to ensure all digits remain between \(1\) and \(9\).
   - Construct each peak by incrementally increasing the digits for the first half and then decrementally decreasing for the second half.
   - Total possible peaks are limited to \(45\), considering all valid \(k\) and \(D1\).

3. **Processing Test Cases:**
   - Precompute all possible peak numbers.
   - For each test case with range \([A, B]\) and multiplier \(M\):
     - Iterate through the precomputed peaks.
     - Count how many peaks fall within the range \([A, B]\) and are divisible by \(M\).

4. **Efficiency Considerations:**
   - Since the total number of peaks is small (\(45\)), iterating through them for each test case is efficient.

**Python Code:**

```python
def generate_peaks():
    peaks = []
    for k in range(0, 10):  # k from 0 to 9
        max_D1 = 9 - k
        for D1 in range(1, max_D1 +1):
            # Generate first k+1 digits
            ascending = [str(D1 + i) for i in range(0, k+1)]
            # Generate last k digits, descending
            descending = [str(D1 + k - i) for i in range(1, k+1)]
            # Combine to form the peak
            digits = ascending + descending
            peak = int(''.join(digits))
            peaks.append(peak)
    return sorted(peaks)

            if not line:
                break
        if not line:
            break
        A_str, B_str, M_str = line.strip().split()
        A = int(A_str)
        B = int(B_str)
        M = int(M_str)
        count =0
        for peak in peaks:
            if A <= peak <= B:
                if peak % M ==0:
                    count +=1
            elif peak > B:
                break
        print(f"Case #{test_case}: {count}")
