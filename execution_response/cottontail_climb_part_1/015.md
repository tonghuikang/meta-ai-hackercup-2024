**Key Findings:**

To solve the problem efficiently, the following approach can be taken:

1. **Understanding Peaks:**
   - A "peak" number has \(2k + 1\) digits, where:
     - The first \(k+1\) digits ascend by 1.
     - The last \(k+1\) digits descend by 1.
   - Each peak can be uniquely determined by two parameters:
     - \(k\): dictates the length of the number.
     - \(d\): the starting digit, ensuring no digit is zero and all digits stay within 1-9.

2. **Generating Peaks:**
   - Iterate over possible values of \(k\) (from 0 to 8). The maximum \(k\) is constrained by \(d + k \leq 9\) to keep digits within 1-9.
   - For each \(k\), iterate over possible starting digits \(d\) (from 1 to \(9 - k\)).
   - Construct the peak by first ascending from \(d\) to \(d + k\), then descending back to \(d\).
   - Store all such peaks in a sorted list.

3. **Processing Test Cases:**
   - For each test case, use binary search to efficiently find the range of peaks that lie within \([A, B]\).
   - Iterate over the filtered peaks and count those divisible by \(M\).

4. **Efficiency:**
   - The total number of peaks is small (45 in the worst case), making it feasible to precompute and store them.
   - Python's arbitrary-precision integers handle large numbers effectively without overflow issues.

**Python Code:**

```python
def main():
    import sys
    import bisect

    # Precompute all peaks
    peaks = []
    for k in range(0, 9):  # since k <=8 (d>=1, d+k <=9)
        for d in range(1, 10):
            if d + k > 9:
                continue
            # Build first k+1 digits
            ascending = [d + i for i in range(k +1)]
            # Build descending k digits (excluding the peak digit)
            descending = [d + k - i for i in range(1, k +1)]
            digits = ascending + descending
            # Convert to integer
            num = 0
            for digit in digits:
                num = num *10 + digit
            peaks.append(num)
    # Remove duplicates if any and sort
    peaks = sorted(peaks)
    # Read input
    input = sys.stdin.read().split()
    T = int(input[0])
    ptr =1
    for test_case in range(1, T+1):
        A = int(input[ptr])
        B = int(input[ptr+1])
        M = int(input[ptr+2])
        ptr +=3
        # Find peaks in [A,B]
        left = bisect.bisect_left(peaks, A)
        right = bisect.bisect_right(peaks, B)
        count =0
        for num in peaks[left:right]:
            if num % M ==0:
                count +=1
        print(f"Case #{test_case}: {count}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
