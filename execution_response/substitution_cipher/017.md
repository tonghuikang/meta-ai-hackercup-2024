**Key Findings:**

To solve this problem efficiently, especially given the large possible size of the input strings, the following approach is taken:

1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) for Decoding Count:**
   - **Objective:** Compute `dp[i]`, the number of ways to decode the substring starting at position `i` to the end.
   - **Approach:** Iterate from the end of the string to the beginning. At each position `i`, consider:
     - **Single Digit:** If the current character (after possible replacement) is between `'1'` and `'9'`, add `dp[i+1]` to `dp[i]`.
     - **Two Digits:** If a valid two-digit number can be formed (i.e., between `10` and `26`), add `dp[i+2]` to `dp[i]`.
   - **Maximization:** When encountering a `'?'`, choose the digit(s) that maximize `dp[i]`, ensuring the overall number of decodings is maximized.

2. **Handling Corrupted Characters (`'?'`):**
   - Replace each `'?'` with digits `'0'` to `'9'`, but only consider replacements that do not lead to invalid encodings (e.g., no leading zeros unless part of a valid two-digit number like `'10'` or `'20'`).
   - For each `'?'`, determine the set of possible digits that maximize the number of decodings from that position.

3. **Reconstruction of the Kth Lexicographically Largest String:**
   - After determining the maximum number of decodings, reconstruct the possible uncorrupted strings that achieve this maximum.
   - **Lexicographical Order:** To find the Kth lexicographically largest string, iterate through the possible digit choices in descending order, and use the count of possible decodings to guide the selection, effectively performing a "binary search" through the possibilities.

4. **Efficiency Considerations:**
   - **Time Complexity:** The approach operates in linear time relative to the length of the string (`O(N)`), which is critical given the constraints.
   - **Space Complexity:** Uses arrays to store `dp` and count values, ensuring space usage is manageable even for large inputs.

5. **Modulo Operation:**
   - Since the number of decodings can be large, all counts are computed modulo `998244353` to prevent integer overflow issues and adhere to the problem's requirements.
