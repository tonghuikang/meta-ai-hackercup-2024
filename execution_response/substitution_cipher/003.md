**Key Findings:**

1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) for Decoding:**
   - Utilize DP to calculate the number of ways to decode the string up to each position.
   - `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to decode the substring `E[0:i]`.
   - Transitions are based on whether a single digit or a pair of digits form a valid letter (1-26).

2. **Handling Corrupted Characters (`?`):**
   - For each `?`, consider all possible digit replacements (`0` to `9`).
   - Carefully handle cases where `?` appears at the beginning or within two-digit pairs to avoid leading zeros and ensure validity (1-26).

3. **Maximizing the Number of Decodings:**
   - To maximize the number of decodings, prefer replacements that allow for the most flexible splits.
   - Favor replacing `?` with digits that increase the number of valid single or double-digit splits (e.g., replacing `?` with `1` or `2` when possible).

4. **Generating Lexicographically Kth Largest String:**
   - After determining the maximum number of decodings, generate all possible uncorrupted strings that achieve this maximum.
   - Sort these strings lexicographically in descending order to find the Kth largest.

5. **Efficient Implementation:**
   - Due to the potential size of `E` (up to 100,000 characters), optimize the DP and string generation steps to run in linear time.
   - Use memoization and modular arithmetic to handle large numbers of decodings efficiently.

6. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - Since the number of decodings can be large, compute all counts modulo `998244353` to prevent integer overflow and meet the problem's requirements.

**Python Code:**

```python
import sys
import math
import sys
import sys
from functools import lru_cache

MOD = 998244353

def main():
    import sys
    import sys
    sys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)
    T = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    for tc in range(1, T + 1):
        E, K = sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()
        K = int(K)
        n = len(E)
        
        dp = [0] * (n + 1)
        dp[0] = 1
        # To track the maximum number of decodings
        # Since replacement can affect the dp counts, it's complex
        # The problem asks to choose the uncorrupted E that maximizes decodings
        # and among those, choose the lex Kth largest
        
        # Idea:
        # Replace '?' with digits that maximize the number of decodings
        # To maximize dp, prefer situations where both single and double digits are possible
        # For lex Kth largest, we need to choose digits in descending order where possible

        # To maximize decodings, at each position:
        # If E[i] is '?', choose digits that maximize possible splits
        # This usually means choosing digits that allow both single and possibly double digits
        # So prefer digits from '1' to '9', avoiding '0' unless necessary

        # However, to properly maximize, we might need to greedily replace '?' with digits that maximize dp
        # But due to complexity, and the need to get lex Kth largest, we need another approach

        # Instead, generate all possible replacements that lead to the maximum dp[n]
        # and count them, then find the Kth lex largest.
        # But with E up to 1e5, this is not feasible.

        # Alternative idea:
        # Since we need to find the lex Kth largest string among those that maximize decodings,
        # we can construct the desired string digit by digit, choosing the highest possible digit
        # at each '?' that still allows the rest to achieve the maximum decodings, and count
        # accordingly to reach the Kth string.

        # First, compute for each position, the number of decodings possible from that position
        # assuming E is fully uncorrupted. But since E has '?', we need to account for all possibilities.

        # To maximize decodings, we need to maximize dp[n], which depends on choices.

        # Plan:
        # 1. From right to left, compute for each position, the number of ways to decode
        # assuming E is uncorrupted optimally.
        # 2. Then, from left to right, construct the lex Kth largest string by choosing
        # the highest possible digit at each '?', considering the remaining number of ways.

        # Implementing step 1:

        # dp_max[i] = maximum number of decodings from position i to end
