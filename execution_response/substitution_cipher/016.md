**Key Findings:**

To solve this problem efficiently, we need to maximize the number of possible decodings of the encoded string while handling corrupted digits represented by question marks (`?`). The primary steps and considerations are:

1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) for Decoding Count:**
   - We utilize a DP approach where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to decode the substring starting from index `i`.
   - The recurrence relation considers both single-digit and two-digit decodings:
     - Single-digit: If the current digit is between '1' and '9', it can be decoded on its own.
     - Two-digit: If the combination of the current and next digit forms a number between '10' and '26', it can be decoded as a pair.
   - When encountering a `?`, we consider all possible valid digits ('1' to '9') that maximize the number of decodings.

2. **Maximizing Decodings with Optimal Replacement:**
   - To maximize decodings, each `?` should be replaced with a digit that allows for the most flexibility in splitting the string. Typically, replacing `?` with '1' or '2' can enable both single and two-digit decodings, increasing the total number of decodings.
   - We prioritize larger digits when reconstructing the uncorrupted string to achieve lexicographical ordering, as required for selecting the Kth largest string.

3. **Reconstructing the Kth Lexicographically Largest String:**
   - After computing the DP table, we reconstruct the string by choosing digits in a way that maximizes the number of decodings while adhering to lexicographical order.
   - At each step, we iterate through possible digit choices in descending order, subtracting the number of possible decodings that each choice would contribute until we reach the desired Kth string.

4. **Handling Large Inputs Efficiently:**
   - Given the constraints (e.g., string length up to 100,000 and multiple test cases), the solution is optimized to run in linear time relative to the string length, ensuring efficiency even for the largest inputs.
