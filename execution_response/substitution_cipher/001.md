To solve this problem, we'll approach it step by step, considering the constraints and the sample input/output carefully.

Firstly, the key task is to find the uncorrupted version(s) of the input string \(E\) that can produce the maximum number of decoded strings, and retrieve the lexicographically \(K\)th largest among them. The challenge is to do this efficiently given the potential size of \(E\) and the number of possibilities arising from the question marks.

**Key Insights:**

1. **Maximum Decodings Correspond to Fibonacci Sequence:**
   
   When considering sequences meant to be split into numbers between 1 and 26, the number of ways to split a sequence of length \(N\) where every position can be split in two ways (single-digit or valid two-digit number) follows the Fibonacci sequence. So if every split position allows for both options, the maximum number of decodings would be \(F(N+1)\), where \(F\) represents the Fibonacci numbers.

2. **Optimal Digits for Maximum Decodings:**

   To maximize the number of decodings, we should arrange the digits so that at as many positions as possible, both one-digit and two-digit decodings are valid. This means:

   - Preferably setting digits at question mark positions to '1' or '2', because '1' and '2' can participate in both valid one-digit numbers (1-9) and valid two-digit numbers (10-19 for '1', 20-26 for '2' when combined correctly).
   - Avoid leading zeros in any chunk, as they are invalid.

3. **Generating Possible Uncorrupted Strings:**

   The possible uncorrupted strings that maximize decodings typically involve replacing '?' with '1' or '2', ensuring that when combined with their neighboring digits, they form valid numbers between 1 and 26.

4. **Limited Number of Maximum-Decoding Strings:**

   Due to the constraints, the number of uncorrupted strings that result in the maximum number of decodings is manageable. This allows us to generate all such strings and sort them lexicographically to find the \(K\)th one.

**Algorithm Steps:**

1. **Compute the Maximum Number of Decodings:**

   Implement the standard dynamic programming approach for the "Decode Ways" problem, but when encountering a '?', we consider all possible valid digits that may maximize decodings.

2. **Determine the Choices at Each Position:**

   Build a list of possible digits for each '?' that contribute to the maximum number of decodings. For positions with fixed digits, we have no choice but to use those digits.

3. **Generate Candidate Uncorrupted Strings:**

   Use backtracking to generate all possible combinations of the digits at the positions of '?', using the choices determined earlier.

4. **Select the Kth Lexicographical String:**

   Sort all the candidate uncorrupted strings that achieve the maximum number of decodings lexicographically and pick the \(K\)th one.

5. **Output the Result:**

   For each test case, output the case number, the chosen uncorrupted string, and the maximum number of decodings modulo \(998{,}244{,}353\).

**Python Code:**

Below is the Python code that implements the above approach. It reads the input, processes each test case according to the strategy discussed, and prints the required output.
