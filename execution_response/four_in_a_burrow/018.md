To solve this problem, the key steps involve analyzing the final grid of the Connect Four game to determine the earliest possible move where either Connie ('C') or Forrest ('F') could have achieved a four-in-a-row. Here's a structured approach:

1. **Grid Analysis**:
   - **Identify Four-in-a-Rows**: Check for all possible horizontal, vertical, and diagonal four-in-a-row sequences for both 'C' and 'F'.
   
2. **Move Number Assignment**:
   - **Minimal Move Number**: For each four-in-a-row sequence, determine the minimal move number required for that sequence to be completed, considering that within each column, cells are filled from bottom to top.
   - **Calculate c_min and f_min**: Find the earliest move number (`c_min` for Connie and `f_min` for Forrest) where they could have first achieved a four-in-a-row.

3. **Determine the Winner**:
   - **Single Winner**: If only one player has a four-in-a-row, that player is the winner.
   - **Both Players Have Four-in-a-Rows**:
     - If `c_min` is less than `f_min`, Connie must have won first.
     - If `f_min` is less than `c_min`, Forrest must have won first.
     - If both `c_min` and `f_min` are equal, it's ambiguous who won first, so output '?'.
   - **No Winner**: If neither player has a four-in-a-row, output '0'.

This approach ensures that we consider the constraints and possible move sequences to accurately determine the game's outcome.
