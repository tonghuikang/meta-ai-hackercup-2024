**Key Findings:**

1. **Turn Order and Move Sequence:**
   - Connie always goes first, followed by Forrest, alternating turns.
   - The total number of moves is 42 (6 rows Ã— 7 columns).
   - Connie makes moves on turns 1, 3, 5, ..., 41 (21 moves).
   - Forrest makes moves on turns 2, 4, 6, ..., 42 (21 moves).

2. **Determining Winning Conditions:**
   - A player wins if they have at least one sequence of four consecutive burrows horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
   - Since the game didn't stop when a player won, multiple winning conditions might exist in the final grid.

3. **Possible Scenarios for Winners:**
   - **Only Connie wins:** If only Connie has a four-in-a-row.
   - **Only Forrest wins:** If only Forrest has a four-in-a-row.
   - **Both win:** If both have four-in-a-row sequences.
     - **If both win, determine who achieved it first:**
       - If the number of Connie's moves is equal to or one more than Forrest's, depending on who could have achieved the winning sequence first.

4. **Collision Scenarios:**
   - If both players have winning sequences, it's possible that one player achieved it without blocking the other, making it unclear who won first.

5. **Implementation Steps:**
   - **Parsing the Grid:** Read the grid from bottom to top since the bottom row is the southern-most row.
   - **Identifying Winning Sequences:** Check all possible horizontal, vertical, and diagonal sequences for both players.
   - **Determining the Winner:**
     - If only one player has a winning sequence, that player is the winner.
     - If both have winning sequences, it's uncertain who won first (`?`).
     - If neither has a winning sequence, output `0`.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - All plots are filled without any four-in-a-row.
   - Overlapping winning sequences where both players have separate four-in-a-row sequences.
   - Multiple winning sequences for the same player.
