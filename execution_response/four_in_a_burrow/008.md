To solve this problem, we need to analyze the final state of a Connect Four grid to determine who must have won the game first. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:

### Key Findings:

1. **Turn Order and Move Counts:**
   - Connie (`C`) always moves first, followed by Forrest (`F`), and they alternate turns.
   - Since the grid has 42 plots (6 rows Ã— 7 columns), each player makes exactly 21 moves.

2. **Winning Conditions:**
   - A player wins if they have four consecutive burrows horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
   - The game is considered to have continued until the grid is fully burrowed, regardless of when a winning condition was met.

3. **Determining the Winner:**
   - **If only `C` has a winning sequence:** `C` must have been the first to achieve four in a row.
   - **If only `F` has a winning sequence:** `F` must have been the first to achieve four in a row.
   - **If both `C` and `F` have winning sequences:**
     - If it's possible that `C` achieved four in a row **before** `F`, then `C` is the winner.
     - If it's possible that `F` achieved four in a row **before** `C`, then `F` is the winner.
     - If both scenarios are possible, output `?` as it's ambiguous who won first.
   - **If neither has a winning sequence:** Output `0`.

4. **Implementation Steps:**
   - **Parsing the Grid:** Read the grid for each test case, ensuring that the bottom row represents the southern-most plots.
   - **Checking for Wins:** For each player, check all possible horizontal, vertical, and diagonal (both left and right) sequences for four consecutive burrows.
   - **Determining the Outcome:** Based on the presence of winning sequences for `C` and/or `F`, determine the appropriate output as per the rules above.

### Python Code:

```python
def check_winner(grid, player):
    rows, cols = 6, 7
    directions = [
        (0, 1),  # Horizontal
        (1, 0),  # Vertical
        (1, 1),  # Diagonal down-right
        (1, -1)  # Diagonal down-left
    ]
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if grid[r][c] != player:
                continue
            for dr, dc in directions:
                count = 1
                for i in range(1, 4):
                    nr, nc = r + dr*i, c + dc*i
                    if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and grid[nr][nc] == player:
                        count += 1
                    else:
                        break
                if count == 4:
                    return True
    return False

def solve_connect_four(test_cases):
    results = []
    for idx, grid in enumerate(test_cases, 1):
        c_win = check_winner(grid, 'C')
        f_win = check_winner(grid, 'F')

        if c_win and not f_win:
            result = 'C'
        elif f_win and not c_win:
            result = 'F'
        elif c_win and f_win:
            # Ambiguous who won first
            result = '?'
        else:
            result = '0'
        
        results.append(f"Case #{idx}: {result}")
    return results

if __name__ == "__main__":
    T = int(input())
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        input()  # Read the empty line
        grid = []
        for _ in range(6):
            row = input().strip()
            grid.append(row)
        test_cases.append(grid)
    
    results = solve_connect_four(test_cases)
    for res in results:
        print(res)
```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Function `check_winner`:**
   - **Purpose:** Determines if a given player (`'C'` or `'F'`) has a winning sequence in the grid.
   - **Parameters:**
     - `grid`: The current state of the grid as a list of strings.
     - `player`: The player to check for (`'C'` or `'F'`).
   - **Process:**
     - Iterates through each cell in the grid.
     - For each cell matching the player, checks in all four directions (horizontal, vertical, two diagonals) for three more consecutive cells matching the player.
     - Returns `True` if a winning sequence is found, else `False`.

2. **Function `solve_connect_four`:**
   - **Purpose:** Processes all test cases and determines the winner for each.
   - **Parameters:**
     - `test_cases`: A list of grids, each representing a test case.
   - **Process:**
     - Iterates through each test case.
     - Uses `check_winner` to determine if `C` and/or `F` have winning sequences.
     - Applies the rules outlined in the key findings to decide the outcome (`'C'`, `'F'`, `'?'`, or `'0'`).
     - Formats the result as specified (e.g., `Case #1: C`).

3. **Main Execution:**
   - Reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, reads the grid (skipping the empty line for readability).
   - Calls `solve_connect_four` with all test cases and prints the results.

This approach ensures that each test case is accurately evaluated based on the final grid state, adhering to the rules of determining who won first or if it's ambiguous.
