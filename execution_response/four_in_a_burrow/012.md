**Key Findings:**

1. **Move Order Reconstruction:** 
   - Each column is filled from bottom to top. Therefore, within a column, lower rows must be filled before higher ones.
   - Players alternate turns starting with Connie (`C`), meaning `C` makes the odd-numbered moves and Forrest (`F`) the even-numbered ones.

2. **Identifying Winning Lines:**
   - Check all possible horizontal, vertical, and diagonal lines of four for both `C` and `F`.
   - When both players have winning lines, determine who completed their winning line first based on the move numbers.

3. **Assigning Move Numbers:**
   - Assign move numbers to each cell respecting the column fill order and player turns.
   - For each potential winning line, identify the latest move in that line which signifies when the four-in-a-row was completed.

4. **Determining the Winner:**
   - If only one player has a winning line, that player is the winner.
   - If both have winning lines, compare the earliest move numbers at which they could have achieved the win. 
     - If `C` achieved it first, output `C`.
     - If `F` achieved it first, output `F`.
     - If it's indeterminate who achieved it first, output `?`.
   - If neither has a winning line, output `0`.
