**Key Findings:**

To determine who won first in the modified Connect Four game, we analyze the final grid by:

1. **Identifying All Four-in-a-Rows:** 
   - We check for all possible horizontal, vertical, and diagonal four-in-a-row sequences for both Connie (`C`) and Forrest (`F`).

2. **Calculating Completion Turns:**
   - For each four-in-a-row, determine the earliest possible turn it could have been completed. This is based on the row positions of the cells involved:
     - The completion turn is the highest row index among the four cells plus one.
     - Adjust this turn to match the player's turn sequence (Connie moves on odd turns, and Forrest on even turns).

3. **Determining the Winner:**
   - Identify the minimal completion turn for both players.
   - Compare these turns:
     - If Connie's minimal turn is earlier, she must have won first (`C`).
     - If Forrest's is earlier, he won first (`F`).
     - If both have the same minimal turn, it's ambiguous (`?`).
     - If neither has a four-in-a-row, there's no winner (`0`).

This method ensures that we honor the game's rules, including the turn order and column constraints.
