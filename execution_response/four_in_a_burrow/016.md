**Key Findings:**

1. **Winning Conditions:** 
   - A player wins by having four consecutive burrows horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
   - We need to check the final grid for winning lines for both Connie (`C`) and Forrest (`F`).

2. **Game Progression:**
   - Players alternate turns starting with Connie.
   - Even though the game continues until the grid is full, the first occurrence of a winning line determines the winner.

3. **Determining the Winner:**
   - **No Winner (`0`):** If neither player has a winning line.
   - **Single Winner (`C` or `F`):** If only one player has a winning line.
   - **Ambiguous (`?`):** If both players have winning lines, we need to determine if one must have achieved their winning line before the other. If it's possible that both achieved their winning lines in the same move, the result is ambiguous.

4. **Handling Multiple Winning Lines:**
   - If both players have winning lines, we need to analyze the move sequence to determine who achieved their line first.
   - Since `C` goes first, if both have winning lines, it's possible that `C` achieved their line before `F`, or they both achieved their lines in the same move, leading to ambiguity.

5. **Implementation Steps:**
   - **Check for Invalid Grids:** Although not required here (as per constraints), generally grids should have burrows stacked from bottom to top without floating burrows.
   - **Identify Winning Lines:** Implement functions to check for horizontal, vertical, and diagonal winning lines for both players.
   - **Determine Win Order:** If both players have winning lines, analyze the turn count and possible move sequences to deduce who must have won first or if it's ambiguous.
   
Based on these findings, here's the Python code to solve the problem:
