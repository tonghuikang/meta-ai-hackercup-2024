To solve the problem of determining who won the Connect Four game first based on the final grid, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify All Winning Lines**: First, find all possible four-in-a-row lines (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally) for both Connie (`C`) and Forrest (`F`) on the final grid.

2. **Determine Critical Cells**: For each four-in-a-row line, identify the "critical cell," which is the highest cell in the four-in-a-row. This cell is the one that was placed last to complete the four-in-a-row.

3. **Simulate Removing Critical Moves**: For each critical cell, simulate removing it from the grid to check if the four-in-a-row still exists. If removing the cell eliminates the four-in-a-row, then that move was essential for forming the win.

4. **Determine the Winner**:
   - If all such critical moves belong to Connie (`C`), then Connie must have won first.
   - If all critical moves belong to Forrest (`F`), then Forrest must have won first.
   - If there are critical moves from both players, it's ambiguous who won first, so output `?`.
   - If no four-in-a-row exists, output `0`.

This approach ensures that we correctly identify the earliest win based on the final grid configuration.

Here's the Python code implementing the above logic:

```python
import sys

def read_grid():
    grid = []
    for _ in range(6):
        line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()
        grid.append(list(line))
    return grid

def find_four_in_a_row(grid):
    lines = []
    rows = 6
    cols = 7
    # Horizontal
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols - 3):
            line = [(r, c + i) for i in range(4)]
            if all(grid[r][c + i] == grid[r][c] for i in range(4)):
                lines.append(line)
    # Vertical
    for c in range(cols):
        for r in range(rows - 3):
            line = [(r + i, c) for i in range(4)]
            if all(grid[r + i][c] == grid[r][c] for i in range(4)):
                lines.append(line)
    # Diagonal down-right
    for r in range(rows - 3):
        for c in range(cols - 3):
            line = [(r + i, c + i) for i in range(4)]
            if all(grid[r + i][c + i] == grid[r][c] for i in range(4)):
                lines.append(line)
    # Diagonal up-right
    for r in range(3, rows):
        for c in range(cols - 3):
            line = [(r - i, c + i) for i in range(4)]
            if all(grid[r - i][c + i] == grid[r][c] for i in range(4)):
                lines.append(line)
    return lines

    return len(find_four_in_a_row(grid)) > 0

        lines = find_four_in_a_row(grid)
        if not lines:
            result = '0'
        else:
