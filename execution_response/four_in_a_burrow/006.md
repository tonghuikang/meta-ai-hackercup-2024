**Key Findings:**

1. **Turn Order and Move Counts:**
   - Connie (`C`) starts first, so the number of `C` burrows should be equal to or exactly one more than the number of `F` burrows.

2. **Identifying Four-in-a-Row:**
   - Check the final grid for any four consecutive `C` or `F` horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
   - Determine whether only `C`, only `F`, both, or neither have achieved four in a row.

3. **Determining Who Won First:**
   - If only `C` or only `F` has a four-in-a-row, that player is the winner.
   - If both have four-in-a-row, simulate the game by incrementally removing the last move and checking if the four-in-a-row still exists.
     - The player whose last move resulted in the four-in-a-row is the winner.
     - If it's ambiguous, output `?`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - Ensure that the grid configuration is valid, i.e., it doesn't have floating burrows (plots above an empty plot in any column).
   - If no player has achieved four in a row, output `0`.
