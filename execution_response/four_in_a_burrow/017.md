To solve the problem of determining who won first in the game of Connect Four played by Connie (`C`) and Forrest (`F`), we follow these steps:

1. **Identify Four-in-a-Rows:**
   - For both `C` and `F`, we identify all possible four-in-a-row patterns horizontally, vertically, and diagonally in the final grid.

2. **Assign Step Numbers:**
   - Since the game proceeds with `C` making the first move, followed by `F`, we assign step numbers to each burrow based on their positions within each column.
   - For Connie (`C`), the step numbers in each column start at 1 and increment by 2 (1, 3, 5, ...).
   - For Forrest (`F`), the step numbers start at 2 and also increment by 2 (2, 4, 6, ...).

3. **Determine Minimum Steps for Four-in-a-Rows:**
   - For each four-in-a-row found for both `C` and `F`, we determine the step number at which that four-in-a-row was completed by taking the maximum of the step numbers of the four cells involved.
   - We then find the smallest such step number across all four-in-a-row patterns for both players.

4. **Compare Step Numbers:**
   - If only one player has a four-in-a-row, that player is the winner.
   - If both players have four-in-a-row patterns, we compare their minimum step numbers:
     - If Connie's minimum step is less than Forrest's, `C` must have won first.
     - If Forrest's minimum step is less than Connie's, `F` must have won first.
     - If both have the same minimum step, it's ambiguous who won first, so we output `?`.
   - If neither player has a four-in-a-row, we output `0`.

This approach ensures that we accurately determine who must have won first based on the final grid configuration.
