**Key Findings:**

1. **Move Sequencing:** Since each column is filled from the bottom up, we can determine the order in which each cell was played by counting the number of burrows in each column. Connie and Forrest alternate turns, with Connie going first.

2. **Tracking Moves:** Assign each cell a move number based on the order they were burrowed. This allows us to reconstruct the sequence of plays.

3. **Win Detection:** After each move, check if the current player has achieved four consecutive burrows horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. If a win is detected, record the player and the move number.

4. **Determining the Winner:**
   - If only one player has a winning move, that player is the winner.
   - If both players have winning moves, determine who achieved it first based on the move numbers.
   - If it's ambiguous who won first, output `?`.
   - If no wins are detected, output `0`.

5. **Edge Cases:** Handle scenarios where multiple winning lines are formed simultaneously or when the game continues after a win was possible.
