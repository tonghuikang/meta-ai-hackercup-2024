**Key Findings:**

To determine who won first in the final state of the Connect Four game, we need to simulate the game's progression step-by-step. Here are the key observations and steps to solve the problem:

1. **Turn Order and Counts:**
   - Connie (`C`) always makes the first move, followed by Forrest (`F`), and they alternate turns.
   - In the final grid, the number of `C` cells will either be equal to or exactly one more than the number of `F` cells.

2. **Validating the Grid:**
   - Ensure that the grid represents a valid game state by checking that in each column, cells are filled from the bottom up without gaps.
   - Validate the count of `C` and `F` moves based on the turn order.

3. **Identifying Wins:**
   - Check if either `C` or `F` has achieved a four-in-a-row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally in the final grid.
   - It's possible that both players have winning sequences in the final grid due to the game continuing until all cells are filled.

4. **Determining the First Winner:**
   - To find out who won first, we need to simulate the game move by move:
     - Iterate through the moves in the order they were played.
     - After each move, check if that move resulted in a win for the current player.
     - The first player to achieve a four-in-a-row during this simulation is the one who won first.
   - If both players have winning sequences that could have been achieved at the same move number, the result is ambiguous (`?`).
   - If no player has a winning sequence, the result is `0`.

5. **Handling Ambiguity:**
   - If both players have winning sequences, but it's unclear who achieved it first based on the move order, the result should be `?`.

By following this approach, we can accurately determine who won first or if the outcome is ambiguous.
