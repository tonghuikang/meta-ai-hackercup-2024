**Key Findings:**

1. **Move Sequence Reconstruction:**
   - The game progresses with Connie (`C`) and Forrest (`F`) alternating turns, starting with Connie.
   - Each move involves placing a burrow in the lowest available row of a chosen column.

2. **Determining the Winning Move:**
   - To identify who won first, we need to simulate the game by removing the last burrow(s) and checking at which point a four-in-a-row was first formed.
   - This involves iteratively removing the most recent moves and checking for winning conditions after each removal.

3. **Handling Multiple Winners:**
   - If both `C` and `F` have four-in-a-row in the final grid, we need to determine whose four-in-a-row was achieved first in any possible move sequence.
   - If `C` must have formed the four-in-a-row before `F` in all valid sequences, then `C` is the winner. Similarly for `F`.
   - If it's possible for either `C` or `F` to have achieved four-in-a-row first depending on the move sequence, the result is ambiguous (`?`).

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If no player has a four-in-a-row in the final grid, the result is `0`.
   - Ensure that the final grid is a valid game state (e.g., no floating burrows).

5. **Implementation Steps:**
   - Parse the grid and determine the order of moves based on the burrow stack in each column.
   - Simulate the game by sequentially adding moves and checking for a winner after each move.
   - Track the earliest point at which a four-in-a-row occurs and identify the corresponding player.
