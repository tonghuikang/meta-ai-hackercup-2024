To solve this problem, we need to determine who must have won first in a game of Connect Four based on the final grid state. Since the game continued until all plots were burrowed, we must consider the order in which the cells could have been filled, respecting the game's stacking and turn-taking rules.

**Key Findings:**

1. **Stacking Constraints:** In Connect Four, you can't place a piece on top of an empty cell. Therefore, a cell can only be filled if all cells below it in the same column have been filled.

2. **Turn Order Constraints:** Players take turns, with Connie starting first. This means Connie moves on odd-numbered turns and Forrest on even-numbered turns.

3. **Earliest Possible Move Numbers:** For each player's cells, we can compute the earliest possible move number at which they could have filled that cell. This depends on:
   - The earliest move they could have played in that column.
   - The stacking constraints within the column.
   - The opponent's pieces (since you might need to wait for the opponent to fill a cell before you can place yours on top).

4. **Determining the Winner:**
   - For each player, find the earliest move number at which they could have created a winning line.
   - If one player's earliest winning move is before the other's, that player must have won first.
   - If both players could have won on the same move, it's impossible to determine who won first (`?`).
   - If no player has a winning line, output `0`.

5. **Implementation Strategy:**
   - **Compute Earliest Move Numbers:** For each cell, assign the earliest possible move number based on stacking and turn order.
   - **Cache Results:** Use memoization to avoid recomputing the earliest move numbers for the same cells.
   - **Find Winning Lines:** Check all possible lines (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) to find winning lines for each player.
   - **Compare Earliest Winning Moves:** Use the earliest winning moves to determine the outcome.

Here's the Python code implementing the above strategy:

```python

    T = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    for case_num in range(1, T + 1):

        for _ in range(6):
            row = sys.stdin.readline().strip()
            grid.append(list(row))
        # Reverse the grid to make row 0 the bottom (southernmost)
        grid = grid[::-1]
        result = solve_case(grid)
        print(f"Case #{case_num}: {result}")

This code reads the input grids, computes the earliest possible move numbers for each player's pieces (taking into account stacking and turn order constraints), identifies all winning lines, and determines who must have won first based on the earliest possible winning moves.
