**Key Findings:**

The problem involves determining whether a specific algorithm correctly computes the shortest path distances between all pairs of nodes in an undirected tree. The algorithm initializes a distance matrix and iteratively updates it using triple nested loops. However, this approach might not work correctly for certain tree structures.

Upon analysis, it becomes evident that the algorithm works correctly only if the tree can be rooted at node 1 (the node with the smallest index) such that all child nodes have higher indices than their parent nodes. This ensures that when processing each node `i`, all intermediary nodes `k` (with `k < i`) have already been processed, allowing correct distance updates. If any node violates this condition (i.e., a child node has an index less than or equal to its parent), the algorithm will fail to compute the correct distances.

To implement this check efficiently, especially given the large constraints, we perform a Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from node 1. During BFS, we verify that each child node has a higher index than its parent. If this condition holds for all nodes, the algorithm is deemed to work correctly (`"Lucky"`); otherwise, it fails (`"Wrong"`).

**Python Code:**

```python
import sys
import threading
from collections import deque

def main():
    import sys
    import sys
    sys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)
    T = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    for test_case in range(1, T +1):
        N = int(sys.stdin.readline())
        adj = [[] for _ in range(N +1)]
        for _ in range(N -1):
            u, v = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
            adj[u].append(v)
            adj[v].append(u)
        # BFS from node1
        queue = deque()
        queue.append(1)
        visited = [False] * (N +1)
        visited[1] = True
        is_lucky = True
        while queue and is_lucky:
            current = queue.popleft()
            for neighbor in adj[current]:
                if not visited[neighbor]:
                    if neighbor <= current:
                        is_lucky = False
                        break
                    visited[neighbor] = True
                    queue.append(neighbor)
        if is_lucky:
            print(f"Case #{test_case}: Lucky")
        else:
            print(f"Case #{test_case}: Wrong")

threading.Thread(target=main).start()
