**Key Findings:**

1. **Algorithm Analysis:** The provided algorithm resembles the Floyd-Warshall algorithm but with a different loop ordering (`i -> k -> j` instead of `k -> i -> j`). This ordering does not guarantee that `dist[i][k]` is minimized before being used to update `dist[i][j}`, leading to potential inaccuracies in the distance matrix.

2. **Tree Structure Dependency:** 
   - **Lucky Cases:** The algorithm correctly computes all-pairs shortest paths (`Lucky`) for trees with at most one node having a degree greater than 2. These trees typically resemble stars or have a single central node with branches, ensuring that distance updates are straightforward and do not require multiple intermediate updates.
   - **Wrong Cases:** For trees with more than one node having a degree greater than 2, the algorithm fails (`Wrong`). This is because the incorrect loop ordering causes some distances to be updated inaccurately when multiple central nodes or complex branching is involved.

3. **Implementation Strategy:** To determine whether the algorithm works correctly for a given tree:
   - **Count Nodes with Degree >2:** For each tree, count the number of nodes that have a degree greater than 2.
   - **Decision Rule:** If the count of such nodes is 1 or fewer, output "`Lucky`". Otherwise, output "`Wrong`".

This approach efficiently checks the necessary condition without simulating the entire algorithm, which would be computationally infeasible given the problem constraints.
