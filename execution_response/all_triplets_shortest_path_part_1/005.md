To solve the problem, we'll implement a Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from node 1, keeping track of each node's parent. We'll use the fact that nodes are numbered from 1 to N, and the labels are simply these node numbers. For the algorithm to work correctly (i.e., to produce the correct distance matrix), the labels along any path from the root (node 1) should be non-decreasing.

Here's the key findings and reasoning:

**Key Findings:**

1. **Observation of the Algorithm:**
   - The given algorithm is similar to the Floyd-Warshall algorithm but with the outer loop over `i` instead of `k`.
   - The order of the loops is critical. The standard Floyd-Warshall algorithm uses the outer loop over `k`, which represents intermediate nodes considered in the path.
   
2. **Tree Properties and Node Labels:**
   - The algorithm works correctly when the tree is rooted at node 1, and the labels (node numbers) along any path from node 1 are non-decreasing.
   - In other words, for every node `u` (except node 1), the label of `u` should be greater than or equal to the label of its parent (`parent[u]`).
   
3. **BFS Traversal:**
   - Using BFS, we traverse the tree, starting from node 1.
   - During traversal, we keep track of each node's parent.
   
4. **Checking Label Conditions:**
   - For each node `u`, we check if `u >= parent[u]`.
   - If this condition fails (i.e., `u < parent[u]`), it means the labels are decreasing along the path, and the algorithm will not produce the correct distance matrix.
   
5. **Implementation Constraints:**
   - We need to perform this check efficiently due to the tight constraints (`N` can be up to `3e5` per test case).
   - BFS traversal ensures we visit each node exactly once, leading to an overall time complexity of `O(N)` per test case.

**Python Code:**

Below is the Python code implementing the above approach.

```python
import sys
import threading
import sys

def main():
    import sys
    import sys
    import threading

    sys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)
    T = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    for case_num in range(1, T + 1):
        N = int(sys.stdin.readline())
        adj = [[] for _ in range(N + 1)]
        for _ in range(N -1):
            u,v = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
            adj[u].append(v)
            adj[v].append(u)

        from collections import deque
        parent = [0] * (N + 1)  # parent[u] = parent of u in BFS
        visited = [False] * (N +1)
        q = deque()
        q.append(1)
        visited[1] = True
        is_lucky = True

        while q and is_lucky:
            u = q.popleft()
            for v in adj[u]:
                if not visited[v]:
                    parent[v] = u
                    visited[v] = True
                    if v >= u:
                        q.append(v)
                    else:
                        # labels decreasing along the path
                        is_lucky = False
                        break
        result = "Lucky" if is_lucky else "Wrong"
        print(f"Case #{case_num}: {result}")

threading.Thread(target=main).start()
