**Key Findings:**

1. **Problem Overview**:
   - We need to determine if Dikjstra's variant of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm correctly computes all-pairs shortest path distances in a given undirected tree.
   - The algorithm iterates through all nodes in a specific order, updating distances based on intermediate nodes.

2. **Algorithm Behavior**:
   - Dikjstra's algorithm processes nodes in the order `i = 1 to N`, and for each `i`, it iterates through all potential intermediate nodes `k = 1 to N`, updating the distance from `i` to every other node `j`.
   - Unlike the standard Floyd-Warshall algorithm, which processes intermediate nodes in a fixed order to ensure correct distance updates, Dikjstra's variant may not respect the necessary dependencies for accurate distance calculations.

3. **Correctness Condition**:
   - For Dikjstra's algorithm to work correctly on a tree, it must process nodes in such a way that when updating the distance from node `i` to node `j` via node `k`, the distance from `i` to `k` has already been correctly computed.
   - This condition holds true if, when the tree is rooted at node `1`, all child nodes have labels greater than their parent nodes. This ensures that during the BFS traversal from the root, nodes are processed in an order that satisfies the dependency requirements of the algorithm.

4. **Implementation Strategy**:
   - **Root the Tree**: Assume node `1` is the root of the tree.
   - **BFS Traversal**: Perform a Breadth-First Search (BFS) to traverse the tree level by level.
   - **Check Label Order**: During traversal, verify that every child node has a higher label than its parent. If any child node has a label less than its parent, the algorithm will fail to compute correct distances, and we should output "`Wrong`".
   - **Optimization**: Given the large constraints (up to 5,000,000 nodes in total), it's crucial to implement the BFS efficiently using adjacency lists and avoid unnecessary computations.

5. **Edge Case Considerations**:
   - **Star Trees**: Trees where one central node is connected to all others (like Test Case 2) satisfy the condition and are labeled "`Lucky`".
   - **Non-star Trees with Correct Labeling**: Trees that are not stars but still satisfy the parent-child label condition (like Test Case 1) are also "`Lucky`".
   - **Incorrect Labeling**: Trees where a child node has a lower label than its parent (like Test Case 3) will result in "`Wrong`".

6. **Conclusion**:
   - By ensuring that the tree is rooted at node `1` and verifying the label order during BFS, we can efficiently determine whether Dikjstra's algorithm will correctly compute all-pairs shortest paths for the given tree.

Below is the Python implementation based on the above findings:

```python
import sys
import threading
from collections import deque

def main():
    import sys

    sys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    T = int(data[idx]); idx +=1
    for test_case in range(1, T+1):
        N = int(data[idx]); idx +=1
        adj = [[] for _ in range(N+1)]
        for _ in range(N-1):
            u = int(data[idx]); v = int(data[idx+1]); idx +=2
            adj[u].append(v)
            adj[v].append(u)
        # BFS from node1
        visited = [False]*(N+1)
        queue = deque()
        queue.append(1)
        visited[1] = True
        is_correct = True
        while queue and is_correct:
            current = queue.popleft()
            for neighbor in adj[current]:
                if not visited[neighbor]:
                    if neighbor < current:
                        is_correct = False
                        break
                    visited[neighbor] = True
                    queue.append(neighbor)
        result = "Lucky" if is_correct else "Wrong"
        print(f"Case #{test_case}: {result}")

threading.Thread(target=main,).start()
