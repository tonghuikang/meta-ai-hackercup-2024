**Key Findings:**

The problem requires determining whether Dikjstra's algorithm correctly computes the shortest path distances for all pairs of nodes in an undirected tree. Upon analysis, we observe that Dikjstra's algorithm resembles the Floyd-Warshall algorithm but with a crucial difference in the ordering of loops. Specifically, Dikjstra's algorithm processes each node `i` first and then iterates over all possible intermediate nodes `k`, potentially leading to incorrect distance computations if the node ordering does not align with BFS traversal.

For the algorithm to work correctly:
- **Node Labeling Constraint:** There must exist a root node (ideally the node with the smallest label) such that in a BFS traversal from this root, every child node has a higher label than its parent. This ensures that when processing nodes in the order of their labels, the algorithm updates distances correctly without encountering situations where a node's neighbor with a smaller label could disrupt the distance calculations.

If this labeling condition is satisfied, the algorithm produces the correct shortest path distances, and we output "Lucky". Otherwise, the algorithm fails to compute the correct distances, and we output "Wrong".
