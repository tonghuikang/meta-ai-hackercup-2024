To determine whether Dikjstra's algorithm correctly computes the all-pairs shortest path distances in a given tree, we need to analyze the algorithm's behavior based on the tree's structure and node numbering.

**Key Findings:**

1. **Algorithm's Loop Order:** The provided algorithm resembles the Floyd-Warshall algorithm but with a different loop order: it iterates first over each node `i`, then over each intermediate node `k`, and finally over each node `j` to update the distance matrix. This loop order can lead to incorrect distance calculations if certain conditions are not met.

2. **Condition for Correctness:** For the algorithm to produce the correct shortest paths:
   - For any pair of nodes `(i, j)`, the maximum node index on the unique path between them should be less than or equal to `max(i, j)`.
   - If there exists a node `u` such that it is the Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) of two nodes `i` and `j` with `u > max(i, j)`, the algorithm will fail.

3. **Implementation Strategy:**
   - **Subtree Minimum Calculation:** For each node, calculate the minimum node index in its subtree.
   - **Violation Detection:** If any node has two or more children with subtree minimums less than itself, it violates the condition, and the algorithm will be incorrect (`"Wrong"`). Otherwise, the algorithm is correct (`"Lucky"`).

4. **Efficient Approach:** Given the constraints (with `N` up to 300,000 per test case and the total sum of `N` across all test cases up to 5,000,000), an efficient O(N) approach using Depth-First Search (DFS) is necessary to compute subtree minimums and check for violations.

Here is the Python code implementing the above strategy:

```python
import sys
import threading

def main():
    import sys
    import sys
    sys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)
    T = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    for test_case in range(1, T + 1):
        N = int(sys.stdin.readline())
        adj = [[] for _ in range(N + 1)]
        for _ in range(N - 1):
            u, v = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
            adj[u].append(v)
            adj[v].append(u)
        # Choose root as N
        root = N
        subtree_min = [N + 1] * (N + 1)
        parent = [0] * (N + 1)
        has_wrong = False
        def dfs(u, p):
            nonlocal has_wrong
            subtree_min[u] = u
            count = 0
            for v in adj[u]:
                if v != p:
                    parent[v] = u
                    dfs(v, u)
                    if subtree_min[v] < u:
                        count +=1
                    subtree_min[u] = min(subtree_min[u], subtree_min[v])
            if count >=2:
                has_wrong = True
        dfs(root, -1)
        print(f"Case #{test_case}: {'Wrong' if has_wrong else 'Lucky'}")
        

threading.Thread(target=main).start()
```
