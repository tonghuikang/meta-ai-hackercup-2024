**Key Findings:**

To determine whether Dikjstra's algorithm correctly computes all-pairs shortest paths in a tree, we need to analyze the structure of the tree. The algorithm's correctness hinges on whether there's a unique central node through which all shortest paths pass. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Tree Centers:** A tree can have one or two centers. If the tree has a unique center, all shortest paths pass through this node, ensuring the algorithm correctly computes distances. If there are two centers, some paths don't pass through a single node, leading to potential inaccuracies in distance calculations.

2. **Algorithm Correctness:**
   - **Lucky:** When the tree has exactly one center.
   - **Wrong:** When the tree has two centers.

3. **Implementation Strategy:**
   - For each test case, build the adjacency list of the tree.
   - Iteratively remove leaf nodes (nodes with degree 1) until one or two nodes remain.
   - If one node remains, output "`Lucky`"; otherwise, output "`Wrong`".

This approach efficiently determines the number of central nodes without simulating the entire algorithm, ensuring it works within the given constraints.
