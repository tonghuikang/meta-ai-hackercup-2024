**Key Findings:**

1. **Efficient Input Handling:** Given the large size of the input (up to 8,000,000 nodes across test cases), it's crucial to read and process the input efficiently. Using `sys.stdin.read()` and splitting the data once helps in minimizing I/O overhead.

2. **Unique Name Mapping:** For each test case, we identify all unique names, sort them lexicographically, and map each name to its corresponding index. This mapping facilitates quick frequency lookups and comparisons.

3. **Tree Representation:** The family tree is represented using adjacency lists, which efficiently handle parent-child relationships without excessive memory usage.

4. **Ancestor Processing (`A_i`):**
   - **Depth-First Search (DFS):** We perform a pre-order DFS traversal to process ancestors. 
   - **Frequency Tracking:** As we traverse, we maintain a frequency count of ancestor names. 
   - **Least Common Ancestor Identification:** For each node, we determine the least common name among its ancestors by tracking the minimum frequency and selecting the smallest index in case of ties.

5. **Descendant Processing (`D_i`):**
   - **Post-Order DFS Traversal:** We perform a post-order traversal to process descendants.
   - **Frequency Aggregation:** We aggregate frequency counts from all descendant subtrees.
   - **Least Common Descendant Identification:** Similar to ancestors, we identify the least common name among descendants using the aggregated frequencies.

6. **Hash Calculation:** To compute the final hash for each test case, we iterate through the `A` and `D` arrays, updating the hash value as per the given formula while ensuring that we perform modulo operations to prevent integer overflow.

7. **Performance Optimization:** Given the constraints, the solution avoids using high-overhead data structures like dictionaries for frequency tracking within DFS traversals. Instead, it leverages lists and precomputed indices for constant-time access and updates.
