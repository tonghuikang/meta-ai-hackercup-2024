The key findings when solving this problem are:

1. **Efficient Traversals**: To compute the least common names among ancestors and descendants, we can perform two tree traversals. A pre-order traversal for ancestor counts and a post-order traversal for descendant counts.

2. **Managing Counts Efficiently**:
   - For ancestor counts (`A_i`), we maintain a global counts dictionary (`counts_dict`) that updates as we traverse the tree. We increment the count of the current node's name before visiting its children and decrement it after returning.
   - For descendant counts (`D_i`), we use dynamic programming in the post-order traversal. Each node maintains its own counts dictionary, which is built by merging the counts of its children. To control memory usage, we merge smaller dictionaries into larger ones.

3. **Finding the Minimum Frequency Name**:
   - For both ancestors and descendants, we need to find the name with the minimum frequency. Since the counts dictionaries contain only unique names (which are comparatively few), we can find the minimum by iterating over the items in these dictionaries.

4. **Handling Large Input Efficiently**:
   - Since the tree can have up to \(3 \times 10^6\) nodes per test case, we use efficient input methods like `sys.stdin.readline()` to read data.
   - We set the recursion limit higher using `sys.setrecursionlimit()` to handle deep recursions that may occur due to the tree's depth.

5. **Preventing Side Effects in Recursive Calls**:
   - When using mutable structures like dictionaries in recursive functions, we ensure modifications are undone after recursion to prevent unintended side effects.

Here is the Python code implementing the above findings:

```python
import sys
import threading
def main():
    import sys
    import threading

    sys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)

    T = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    for test_case in range(1, T + 1):
        N = int(sys.stdin.readline())
        P = []
        S = []
        name_set = set()
        for _ in range(N):
            parts = sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()
            p = int(parts[0])
            s = parts[1]
            P.append(p)  # store parent index
            S.append(s)  # store name
            name_set.add(s)

        # Map names to indices
        U = sorted(list(name_set))
        name_to_id = {name: idx + 1 for idx, name in enumerate(U)}  # names mapped to 1..|U|
        M = len(U)

        name_ids = [name_to_id[s] for s in S]  # list of name IDs

        # Build tree
        tree = [[] for _ in range(N)]

**Notes**:

- We used `threading.Thread` to run the `main` function to prevent stack overflow in some environments like online judges.
- The `dfs_desc` function calculates the descendant counts and updates `D_i`.
- The `dfs_anc` function calculates the ancestor counts and updates `A_i`.
- We carefuly manage the `counts` dictionaries in both functions to prevent side effects between recursive calls.
- We set the recursion limit high enough to handle deep recursive calls.
