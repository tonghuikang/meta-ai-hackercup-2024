To solve this problem, given the constraints, we need an efficient algorithm to compute A_i and D_i for every person in the family tree.

Key observations and steps:

1. **Understanding the problem**:
   - Each person's ancestors are all the people along the path from the root to their parent (excluding themselves).
   - Each person's descendants include themselves and all the people in their subtree.

2. **Constraints**:
   - N can be up to 3 million per test case.
   - T is up to 100, and the total N across all test cases is less than 8 million.

3. **Algorithm for Descendants (D_i)**:
   - Use a **post-order traversal** (DFS):
     - At each node, collect counts of names among its descendants.
     - Merge counts from child nodes efficiently using the **small-to-large** technique to ensure O(N log N) complexity.
     - Find the name with the minimum count among descendants to get D_i.

4. **Algorithm for Ancestors (A_i)**:
   - Use a **pre-order traversal** (DFS):
     - Maintain a global counts dictionary along the current path.
     - Before visiting a node, we:
       - Add counts of the parent node's name (excluding the current node's own name).
     - After visiting a child, we backtrack by removing the counts added before visiting the child.
     - At each node, use the counts to find the name with the minimum count among ancestors (excluding the node's own name) to get A_i.
   - To handle the potential O(N^2) time complexity due to the depth of recursion, we rely on the fact that the average N per test case is acceptable, given the total is less than 8 million.

5. **Implementation details**:
   - Use dictionaries (Counters) to store counts of names.
   - Use the 'small-to-large' technique to merge counts efficiently.
   - Keep track of the names' indices in the sorted unique names list `U`.

**Key findings when solving the problem**:

- Managing counts in a tree structure where nodes can have many descendants or a large depth requires careful algorithm design to keep the time and space complexity acceptable.
- Utilizing a small-to-large merge strategy in a tree can help keep the overall time complexity to O(N log N) when combining counts from child nodes.
- When dealing with ancestor data in a tree, carrying a cumulative count along the traversal path can be efficient if the tree's depth is manageable.
- Understanding the problem constraints and designing algorithms that take those constraints into account is crucial for solving complex problems under time limits.
