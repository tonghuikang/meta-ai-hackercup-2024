When approaching this problem, several key observations and strategies are essential due to the large constraints:

1. **Unique Name Identification**:
   - Collect all unique names across the family tree and sort them lexicographically to form the list \( U \).
   - Assign each unique name an index based on this sorted list for easy reference.

2. **Tree Construction**:
   - Given that each parent \( P_i \) satisfies \( P_i < i \), construct the tree incrementally in order.
   - This allows for efficient traversal since parents are always processed before their children.

3. **Ancestor Frequency Calculation (\( A_i \))**:
   - Perform a Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal of the tree.
   - Maintain a frequency array to keep track of the number of times each name appears in the current path from the root to the current node's parent.
   - At each node, determine the name with the smallest frequency among its ancestors. In case of ties, choose the name with the smallest index in \( U \).
   - Update \( A_i \) accordingly. If a node has no ancestors, \( A_i = 0 \).

4. **Descendant Frequency Calculation (\( D_i \))**:
   - Utilize a post-order DFS traversal to process all descendants before the current node.
   - Similar to ancestor frequency, maintain a frequency array for the subtree rooted at the current node.
   - Determine the name with the smallest frequency in the subtree. In case of ties, choose the name with the smallest index in \( U \).
   - Update \( D_i \) accordingly. If a node has no descendants, \( D_i = 0 \).

5. **Hash Computation**:
   - To handle the large output efficiently, compute a hash by iteratively combining the values of \( A \) and \( D \) as specified, taking care to apply the modulo operation to prevent integer overflow.

6. **Optimization Considerations**:
   - Implement the solution in **PyPy** to leverage its speed advantages for handling large datasets.
   - Use efficient data structures like lists and dictionaries with preallocated sizes to minimize overhead.
   - Avoid unnecessary computations and ensure that all operations within the DFS traversals are optimized for speed.

Given these strategies, here's the optimized Python code to solve the problem:
