When approaching this problem, several key challenges and strategies must be considered:

1. **Efficient Input Parsing:** Given the large input size, it's crucial to read the input efficiently. This can be achieved by reading the entire input at once and processing it accordingly.

2. **Tree Representation:** The family tree can be represented using adjacency lists, which are memory-efficient and allow for fast traversal.

3. **Handling Names:**
   - Collect all unique names and sort them lexicographically to create the list \( U \).
   - Assign each unique name an index based on its position in \( U \).

4. **Computing \( A_i \) (Least Common Ancestor Name):**
   - Perform a Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal from the root.
   - Maintain a frequency array to keep track of the count of each name along the current path from the root to the current node.
   - Keep track of the minimum frequency and the corresponding name index. Update these values as you traverse the tree.
   - Assign \( A_i \) for each node based on the current minimum frequency name.

5. **Computing \( D_i \) (Least Common Descendant Name):**
   - Perform a post-order DFS traversal.
   - For each node, merge the frequency counts of its children.
   - Determine the least common name in the subtree by maintaining the minimum frequency and the corresponding name index.
   - Assign \( D_i \) for each node based on the computed least common descendant name.

6. **Hash Computation:**
   - After computing \( A \) and \( D \) arrays, compute the hash as specified, ensuring to handle large numbers efficiently using modulo operations.

7. **Optimization Considerations:**
   - Use efficient data structures like arrays instead of dictionaries to handle frequency counts due to the large size constraints.
   - Avoid recursive DFS in Python for very deep trees by implementing iterative DFS to prevent stack overflow and reduce overhead.

Below is the Python implementation encapsulating the above strategies:
