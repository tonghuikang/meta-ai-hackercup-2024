When tackling this problem, several critical insights and strategies are essential to handle the large data constraints efficiently:

### Key Findings:

1. **Efficient Input Handling:**
   - Given the large input size (up to 8,000,000 nodes across all test cases), it's crucial to read input efficiently. Utilizing fast input methods like `sys.stdin` and avoiding standard input functions can significantly reduce runtime.

2. **Mapping and Sorting Unique Names:**
   - Extract all unique names across each test case and sort them lexicographically to form list \( U \). Assign each unique name an index based on this sorted order for quick reference.

3. **Tree Representation:**
   - Represent the family tree using adjacency lists for efficient traversal. This approach facilitates both ancestor and descendant computations without excessive memory overhead.

4. **Ancestor Frequency Calculation (\( A_i \)):**
   - Perform a Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal from the root. Maintain a frequency counter (e.g., a dictionary or list) to track the occurrence of names along the current path (ancestors).
   - At each node, determine the least common name among its ancestors by iterating through the frequency counter. To optimize, maintain a data structure that keeps track of the current least frequent name, updating it dynamically as the traversal progresses.
   - If a node has no ancestors (i.e., it's the root), set \( A_i = 0 \).

5. **Descendant Frequency Calculation (\( D_i \)):**
   - Utilize post-order DFS traversal to calculate frequencies within each subtree (descendants).
   - Similar to ancestor calculation, maintain a frequency counter for each subtree and determine the least common name. Efficiently merge frequency counts from child subtrees to the parent to minimize redundant computations.
   - If a node has no descendants (i.e., it's a leaf), set \( D_i = 0 \).

6. **Hash Computation:**
   - After obtaining the \( A \) and \( D \) arrays for each test case, compute the hash as specified. Given the potential size of the arrays, ensure that the hash computation is performed efficiently, possibly by iterating through the arrays without storing them entirely in memory.

7. **Memory Management:**
   - Due to the problem's scale, it's imperative to manage memory usage carefully. Reuse data structures where possible and avoid storing unnecessary intermediate results.

8. **Optimizations:**
   - Precompute and cache repeated operations, such as name indexing.
   - Utilize bit manipulation or other low-level optimizations if necessary to speed up frequency calculations.

By adhering to these strategies, the problem can be solved within the given constraints efficiently.
