**Key Findings:**

1. **Efficient Input Handling:**
   - Given the large size of data (up to 8,000,000 nodes across test cases), it's crucial to read the input efficiently. Using `sys.stdin` with buffered reading methods like `sys.stdin.read()` and parsing it manually can significantly speed up the input process compared to line-by-line reading.

2. **Name Mapping and Sorting:**
   - To manage names effectively, map each unique name to a unique index based on lexicographical order. This allows for faster comparisons and easier handling of name frequencies.

3. **Tree Representation:**
   - Represent the family tree as an adjacency list for efficient traversal. Since each person (except the root) has exactly one parent, building child lists for each node will facilitate both ancestor and descendant traversals.

4. **Frequency Counting for Ancestors:**
   - Traverse the tree using Depth-First Search (DFS) while maintaining a frequency count of names along the current path (from root to the current node). At each node, determine the least common ancestor name by examining the current frequency map.

5. **Frequency Counting for Descendants:**
   - Perform a post-order DFS traversal to count the frequency of each name in the subtree rooted at each node. This allows determining the least common descendant name for each node.

6. **Handling Least Common Name Selection:**
   - For both ancestors and descendants, after determining the frequency of each relevant name, select the name with the smallest frequency. In case of ties, choose the name with the smallest index in the sorted unique names list.

7. **Hash Calculation:**
   - Compute the hash as specified by iterating through each node, updating the hash value by incorporating `A[i]` and `D[i]` in the prescribed manner. Ensure that the modulo operation is performed at each step to prevent integer overflow.

8. **Optimizations:**
   - Utilize lists and dictionaries efficiently to manage memory usage, especially given the constraints on the number of nodes.
   - Precompute necessary data structures like name indices and adjacency lists to avoid redundant computations during traversals.

9. **Edge Cases:**
   - Handle cases where a node has no ancestors or no descendants by assigning `0` to `A[i]` or `D[i]` respectively, as per the problem statement.

By incorporating these findings into the solution, we can ensure that the program runs efficiently within the given constraints.
