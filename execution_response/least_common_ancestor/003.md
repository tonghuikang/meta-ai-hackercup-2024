### Key Findings

1. **Efficient Parsing and Storage**: Given the constraints with up to 8,000,000 nodes across all test cases, it's crucial to read and process the input efficiently. Using data structures like adjacency lists for tree representation and mapping names to unique indices helps in managing memory and access times.

2. **Lexicographical Ordering of Unique Names**: Extracting and sorting the unique names lexicographically is essential since the indices in `U` depend on this order. This allows for consistent mapping and handling of tie-breakers based on name indices.

3. **Ancestor Frequency Tracking**:
   - **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Utilize DFS to traverse the tree from the root, maintaining a frequency map of ancestor names.
   - **Updating Frequencies**: As we enter a node, increment the frequency of its name. After processing its children, decrement the frequency to backtrack correctly.
   - **Determining `A_i`**: For each node, iterate through the unique names to find the one with the lowest frequency among ancestors, handling ties by selecting the name with the smallest index.

4. **Descendant Frequency Tracking**:
   - **Post-Order DFS**: Traverse the tree in post-order to aggregate frequency counts from descendants.
   - **Merging Frequency Maps**: Combine frequency maps from child nodes efficiently, preferably by always merging the smaller map into the larger one to optimize time complexity.
   - **Determining `D_i`**: Similar to ancestors, identify the least common name among descendants for each node.

5. **Hash Calculation**:
   - **Modular Arithmetic**: To prevent integer overflow and adhere to the problem's modulus requirement, perform modular operations at each step of the hash computation.
   - **Sequential Processing**: Iterate through nodes in order, updating the hash based on the precomputed `A_i` and `D_i` values.

6. **Optimizations**:
   - **Memory Management**: Reuse data structures where possible and avoid unnecessary storage to handle large inputs efficiently.
   - **Fast Input Methods**: Utilize faster input reading techniques like `sys.stdin` buffer to manage large input sizes without significant delays.
   - **Preprocessing**: Precompute and store mappings and sorted lists to reduce redundant computations during traversal.
