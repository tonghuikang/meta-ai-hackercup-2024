When solving the **Meta Snacker Cup** problem, the key challenge is to compute the total number of valid original orders (`s`) given the constraints on the Hamming distances between the orders and their possible deviations. The problem can be broken down into combinatorial scenarios where we need to account for how the original order can differ from the recorded orders (`S1` and `S2`) and how these deviations affect the count of valid `s`.

### Key Findings:

1. **Hamming Distance Relationships**:
   - The Hamming distance between `S1` and `S2` is `H`. We need to count all possible strings `s` that are within `M1` mistakes from `S1` and within `M2` mistakes from `S2`.
   
2. **Combinatorial Breakdown**:
   - The problem can be segmented based on how many positions `s` differs from `S1` and `S2`.
   - For positions where `S1` and `S2` are the same, `s` can either match or differ from these positions.
   - For positions where `S1` and `S2` differ, `s` has limited options: it can match `S1`, match `S2`, or differ from both. The number of valid configurations for these differences is crucial.

3. **Formula Derivation**:
   - The total number of valid configurations can be derived by iterating over possible mismatches `t` and computing combinations using binomial coefficients.
   - Special handling is required when the size of the alphabet `Î£` is exactly 2, as it restricts the choices for `s`.

4. **Modular Arithmetic**:
   - Due to potentially large numbers, all computations are performed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

5. **Efficient Computation**:
   - Precompute factorials and inverse factorials to efficiently calculate binomial coefficients.
   - Utilize fast exponentiation to handle large powers.

### Python Code:

```python
import sys
import math

MOD = 10**9 + 7
MAX = 10000

# Precompute factorial and inverse factorial
fact = [1] * (MAX + 1)
for i in range(1, MAX +1):
    fact[i] = fact[i-1] * i % MOD

inv_fact = [1] * (MAX +1)
inv_fact[MAX] = pow(fact[MAX], MOD-2, MOD)
for i in range(MAX, 0, -1):
    inv_fact[i-1] = inv_fact[i] * i % MOD

def comb(n, k):
    if n <k or k <0:
        return 0
    return fact[n] * inv_fact[k] % MOD * inv_fact[n -k] % MOD
