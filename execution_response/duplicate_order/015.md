To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of valid triples \((S1, S2, s)\), where \(S1\) and \(S2\) are two strings differing in exactly \(H\) positions, and \(s\) is a string that lies within \(M1\) Hamming distance from \(S1\) and within \(M2\) Hamming distance from \(S2\). 

The key steps are:

1. **Combinatorial Counting**: 
   - First, choose \(H\) positions out of \(N\) where \(S1\) and \(S2\) will differ. This can be done in \(C(N, H)\) ways.
   - For each of these \(H\) differing positions, \(S2\) can be any of the \(|\Sigma| - 1\) characters different from \(S1\).
   - There are \((|\Sigma| - 1)^H\) ways to choose these differing characters for \(S2\).

2. **Intersection Size Calculation**: 
   - For each pair \((S1, S2)\), the number of valid \(s\) strings that lie within \(M1\) and \(M2\) Hamming distances is calculated by considering how \(s\) can match or differ from \(S1\) and \(S2\) in those \(H\) differing positions.
   - The formula for the intersection size simplifies to \((|\Sigma| + 1)^H\).

3. **Final Calculation**:
   - The total number of valid triples \((S1, S2, s)\) is given by \(C(N, H) \times (|\Sigma| - 1)^H \times (|\Sigma| + 1)^H \times |\Sigma|^{N - H}\).

Given that the requirements need the sum to be modulo \(10^9 + 7\), we implement this formula in Python while taking care to compute factorials and their modular inverses efficiently to handle large values of \(N\).

Here is the Python code implementing the solution:

```python
import sys
import math
import sys

MOD = 10**9 + 7

def precompute_factorials(max_n):
    fact = [1] * (max_n + 1)
    for i in range(1, max_n +1):
        fact[i] = fact[i-1] * i % MOD
    inv_fact = [1] * (max_n +1)
    inv_fact[max_n] = pow(fact[max_n], MOD -2, MOD)
    for i in range(max_n -1, -1, -1):
        inv_fact[i] = inv_fact[i+1] * (i+1) % MOD
    return fact, inv_fact

def comb(n, k, fact, inv_fact):
    if k <0 or k >n:
        return 0
    return fact[n] * inv_fact[k] % MOD * inv_fact[n -k] % MOD

def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    T = int(data[0])
    idx =1
    max_n=0
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[idx])
        M1 = int(data[idx +1])
        M2 = int(data[idx +2])
        H = int(data[idx +3])
        Sigma = int(data[idx +4])
        test_cases.append( (N, M1, M2, H, Sigma))
        max_n = max(max_n, N)
        idx +=5
    fact, inv_fact = precompute_factorials(max_n)
    for tc, (N, M1, M2, H, Sigma) in enumerate(test_cases,1):
        if H > N:
            total =0
            print(f"Case #{tc}: {total}")
            continue
        C_N_H = comb(N, H, fact, inv_fact)
        Sigma_minus1 = Sigma -1
        Sigma_plus1 = Sigma +1
        term1 = C_N_H * pow(Sigma_minus1, H, MOD) % MOD
        term2 = pow(Sigma +1, H, MOD)
        term3 = pow(Sigma, N - H, MOD) if N - H >=0 else 1
        total = term1 * term2 % MOD
        total = total * term3 % MOD
        print(f"Case #{tc}: {total}")
```

```python
# To execute the solution, you should call the `solve` function. 
# However, since this platform does not support direct execution with custom input,
# you can copy and execute this code in your local Python environment.
``` 

This code precomputes the factorials and their inverses up to the maximum \(N\) across all test cases. For each test case, it calculates the number of valid triples by combining the combinatorial counts and the intersection size using the derived formula. The final answer is printed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
