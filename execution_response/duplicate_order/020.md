To solve this problem efficiently, we need to carefully analyze the relationships between the original string and the recorded orders while leveraging combinatorial mathematics and dynamic programming techniques. Here are the key findings and approach:

**Key Findings:**

1. **Hamming Distance Constraints:**
   - Given two strings \( S_1 \) and \( S_2 \) with Hamming distance \( H \), we need to count the number of original strings \( s \) that are within \( M_1 \) Hamming distance from \( S_1 \) and within \( M_2 \) Hamming distance from \( S_2 \).
   
2. **Combinatorial Approach:**
   - The problem can be broken down into choosing how many positions differ between \( s \) and \( S_1 \), and between \( s \) and \( S_2 \).
   - For positions where \( S_1 \) and \( S_2 \) are identical (i.e., \( N - H \) positions), we can choose to either keep the character the same or change it.
   - For the \( H \) differing positions, \( s \) can match \( S_1 \), match \( S_2 \), or differ from both.
   
3. **Efficient Computation:**
   - Precompute factorials and inverse factorials modulo \( 1{,}000{,}000{,}007 \) to efficiently calculate binomial coefficients.
   - Use dynamic programming to compute the required sums by iterating over possible choices and ensuring Hamming distance constraints are met.
   
4. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - Since the answer can be very large, all computations are done modulo \( 1{,}000{,}000{,}007 \).

With these insights, the following Python code implements the solution efficiently:
