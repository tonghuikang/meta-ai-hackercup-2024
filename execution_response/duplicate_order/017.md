To solve this problem efficiently, especially given the large constraints, we can employ combinatorial mathematics and dynamic programming. Here's a breakdown of the key findings and the approach used:

### Key Findings:

1. **Hamming Distance Concepts**:
   - **Hamming Distance (H)** between two strings \( S_1 \) and \( S_2 \) of length \( N \) is the number of positions at which the corresponding symbols are different.
   - The goal is to count the number of possible original strings \( s \) that are within \( M_1 \) Hamming distance from \( S_1 \) and within \( M_2 \) Hamming distance from \( S_2 \).

2. **Combinatorial Representation**:
   - Let \( K = N - H \) be the number of positions where \( S_1 \) and \( S_2 \) agree.
   - We can categorize the positions based on whether \( s \) matches \( S_1 \) and/or \( S_2 \) in those positions.
   - The problem reduces to finding valid combinations of these matches that satisfy the Hamming distance constraints.

3. **Dynamic Programming (DP) and Binomial Coefficients**:
   - Precompute factorials and inverse factorials modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) to efficiently calculate binomial coefficients.
   - Use dynamic programming to iterate through possible overlaps between \( S_1 \), \( S_2 \), and the original string \( s \), ensuring that the Hamming distance constraints are respected.

4. **Modular Arithmetic**:
   - Since the answers can be very large, all calculations are done modulo \( 1,000,000,007 \).

5. **Optimization**:
   - Precompute necessary combinatorial values to handle large values of \( N \) (up to 10,000) efficiently.
   - Avoid redundant calculations by leveraging the symmetry and combinatorial properties of the problem.

### Python Implementation:

Below is the Python code that implements the above approach. It reads the input, processes each test case using the combinatorial method, and outputs the result modulo \( 1,000,000,007 \).

```python
import sys
import math

MOD = 10**9 + 7

def precompute_factorials(max_n):
    factorial = [1] * (max_n + 1)
    for i in range(1, max_n +1):
        factorial[i] = factorial[i-1] * i % MOD
    inv_fact = [1] * (max_n +1)
    inv_fact[max_n] = pow(factorial[max_n], MOD-2, MOD)
    for i in range(max_n-1, -1, -1):
        inv_fact[i] = inv_fact[i+1] * (i+1) % MOD
    return factorial, inv_fact

def comb(n, k, factorial, inv_fact):
    if n < 0 or k < 0 or k > n:
        return 0
    return factorial[n] * inv_fact[k] % MOD * inv_fact[n - k] % MOD

    data = input().split()
    T = int(data[0])
    idx = 1

    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        N, M1, M2, H, Sigma = map(int, data[idx:idx+5])
        test_cases.append((N, M1, M2, H, Sigma))
        max_N = max(max_N, N)
        idx +=5
    factorial, inv_fact = precompute_factorials(max_N)
    for tc in range(1, T+1):
        N, M1, M2, H, Sigma = test_cases[tc-1]
        if H > N or M1 > N or M2 > N:

        total_pairs = pow(S, N, MOD) * comb(N, H, factorial, inv_fact) % MOD
        total_pairs = comb(N, H, factorial, inv_fact) * pow(S-1, H, MOD) % MOD * pow(S, K, MOD) % MOD
        # Now, for each pair (S1, S2) with hamming distance H, compute the number of s
        # Due to symmetry, we can fix S1 and S2 and compute the count, then multiply by total_pairs / (S^N)
        # But to avoid floating division, we compute directly
        # The number of valid s for a given (S1,S2) is sum over a=0 to K, y=0 to H, w=0 to H
        # such that a + H - y <= M1 and a + H - w <= M2, and y + w <= H + min(M1, M2) - a
