Let me analyze each solution:

Solution 002:
- Sample input: Correct (matches expected output)
- Full input: Output seems reasonable with a mix of Yes/No answers
- Algorithm looks solid with proper geometric transformations and checks

Solution 010:
- Sample input: Wrong (all "No" when some should be "Yes")
- Full input: Seems suspicious with mostly "No" answers
- Algorithm likely too restrictive

Solution 011:
- Sample input: Wrong (all "No")
- Full input: Mostly "No" with few "Yes"
- Algorithm appears to be missing valid cases

Solution 001:
- Sample input: Wrong (Yes/No/No instead of Yes/No/Yes)
- Full input: Mix of Yes/No but doesn't match other solutions
- Algorithm seems to have issues with rotation calculations

Solution 003:
- Sample input: Wrong (all "No")
- Full input: Mostly "No" with few "Yes"
- Algorithm appears too restrictive

Solution 007:
- Sample input: Wrong (all "No")
- Full input: All "No"
- Algorithm is clearly too restrictive

Solution 000:
- Sample input: Wrong (all "No")
- Full input: All "No"
- Algorithm fails to detect valid cases

Solution 009:
- Sample input: Wrong (all "No")
- Full input: All "No"
- Algorithm is overly restrictive

Solution 008:
- Sample input: Wrong (all "No")
- Full input: All "No"
- Algorithm fails to detect valid cases

Solution 006:
- Sample input: Wrong (all "No")
- Full input: All "No"
- Algorithm is too restrictive

Solution 005:
- Sample input: Wrong (all "No")
- Full input: All "No"
- Algorithm fails to detect valid cases

Solution 004:
- Sample input: Wrong (all "No")
- Full input: All "No"
- Algorithm is overly restrictive

Comparing algorithms:
1. Most solutions (000, 003-011) are clearly wrong as they output almost all "No" answers
2. Solution 001 shows inconsistent behavior with the sample input
3. Solution 002 stands out as it:
   - Correctly handles the sample input
   - Produces a reasonable distribution of Yes/No answers in the full input
   - Has proper geometric transformations and validation checks
   - Handles edge cases and floating-point precision appropriately

The best solution is <index>002</index> because:
1. It's the only solution that correctly handles the sample input
2. Its algorithm properly implements all required checks:
   - Rotation of polygon
   - Translation after rotation
   - Checking vertices position relative to x-axis
   - Verifying points inside the cup
   - Ensuring no overlap with cup boundaries
3. It handles floating-point precision issues appropriately
4. It produces reasonable results for the full input with a mix of Yes/No answers, suggesting it's actually detecting valid cases instead of being too restrictive or too permissive
