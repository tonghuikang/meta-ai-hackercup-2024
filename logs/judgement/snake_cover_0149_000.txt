Let me analyze each solution:

Solution 003:
- Sample output: Case #1: 21, Case #2: 66
- This matches the expected sample output exactly
- Full input output looks reasonable without obvious anomalies or patterns
- The algorithm maintains head and tail positions correctly and calculates minimum bounding rectangle areas

Solution 001:
- Sample output: Case #1: 68, Case #2: 97
- This doesn't match the expected sample output
- Full input output has some reasonably sized numbers but they're incorrect given the sample output is wrong
- The algorithm has flaws in calculating the bounding rectangle area

Solution 000:
- Sample output: Case #1: 40, Case #2: 29
- This doesn't match the expected sample output
- Full input output has reasonable-looking numbers but they're incorrect since the sample output is wrong
- The algorithm has issues with area calculation and segment tracking

Solution 002:
- Sample output: Case #1: 88, Case #2: 144
- This doesn't match the expected sample output
- Full input output shows larger numbers than other solutions, suggesting overcounting
- The algorithm seems to have issues with properly tracking the snake's minimum area

Comparing the algorithms:
- Solution 003 uses a correct approach tracking both head and tail positions, properly handling direction changes, and calculating minimum areas during moves
- Solution 001 has issues with area calculation, not properly considering the minimal area during moves
- Solution 000 has problems with segment tracking and area minimization
- Solution 002 overcounts areas and doesn't properly track the snake's minimal configuration

The best solution is <index>003</index> because:
1. It's the only solution that produces correct output for the sample input
2. It properly maintains head and tail positions
3. It correctly calculates the minimum bounding rectangle area during moves
4. Its implementation handles both the direction changes and movement properly
5. The algorithm efficiently tracks the snake's configuration without trying to store all positions
6. It properly implements the problem's requirements for calculating f(i) as the minimum area during each move
7. The output values for the full input appear reasonable and consistent with the problem constraints
