Let me analyze the only solution provided (000):

Sample Input Analysis:
- Case #1: Solution outputs 16, expected 24 (Wrong)
- Case #2: Solution outputs 0, expected 0 (Correct)
- Case #3: Solution outputs 519900361, expected 992573627 (Wrong)
- Case #4: Solution outputs 81243131, expected 590806193 (Wrong)
- Case #5: Solution outputs 26250000, expected 33750000 (Wrong)

Full Input Analysis:
- The outputs appear to be within reasonable bounds (all below 10^9+7)
- Some test cases result in 0, which is possible when constraints can't be satisfied
- No obvious issues like negative numbers or numbers exceeding modulo
- Values seem distributed across the possible range

Algorithm Analysis:
The solution (000) has several issues:
1. It incorrectly calculates the number of possible strings for the first case
2. The combinatorial calculations appear to have errors in handling the intersection of valid strings for S1 and S2
3. The code has many commented sections showing uncertainty about the final calculation

Since this is the only solution provided, I cannot make a comparison with other solutions or identify the best solution.

To properly identify the best solution, I would need at least two solutions to compare. With only one solution that produces incorrect results for the sample cases, I cannot recommend it as the best solution.

I cannot present a "best solution" format as requested because there's only one solution to analyze, and it's incorrect based on the sample cases.

Would you like to provide additional solutions for comparison?
