Let me analyze each solution:

Solution 004:
- Sample input: Correct (Case #1: 2, Case #2: 3)
- Full input: Output appears consistent, with reasonable values (mostly 8 for large N)

Solution 002:
- Sample input: Correct (Case #1: 2, Case #2: 3)
- Full input: Output shows much larger values (up to ~58,981 for large N)

Algorithm comparison:
1. Solution 004 uses a different approach by checking prime differences using bit operations. It considers only the existence of prime differences, resulting in smaller counts.

2. Solution 002 counts all twin prime pairs up to N. This approach is fundamentally wrong because:
   - It counts ALL twin primes up to N, rather than just the primes that can be expressed as differences
   - The numbers it produces (like 58,981) are too large to be reasonable, as there can't be that many primes that are differences of two primes ≤ N

The best solution is <index>004</index> because:
1. It correctly interprets the problem definition by checking for each prime S whether it can be expressed as a difference of two primes ≤ N
2. Its output values are more reasonable (maximum of 8 for large N)
3. It handles edge cases correctly (N < 2)
4. The bit manipulation approach is efficient and avoids overcounting
5. The results align with the problem constraints and mathematical logic - there should be a limited number of primes that can be expressed as differences of two primes
