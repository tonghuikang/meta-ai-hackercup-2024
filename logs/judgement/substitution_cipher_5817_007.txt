Let me analyze the only solution provided (002):

For solution 002:
- Sample input analysis:
  - All test cases in the sample input match exactly with the expected output
  - The solution correctly handles different patterns including '?' replacements and counting decodings

- Full input analysis:
  - No obviously wrong outputs detected
  - The solution maintains consistent logic across all test cases
  - The numbers are within reasonable bounds
  - The solution handles various edge cases appropriately
  - The decoding counts are properly calculated modulo 998244353

Algorithm analysis:
The solution uses a solid approach:
1. For each '?', it strategically assigns '1' or '2' to maximize decoding possibilities
2. Uses dynamic programming to count valid decodings
3. Handles the lexicographical ordering requirement by making optimal choices for the Kth largest string
4. Properly implements the modulo arithmetic

Since there is only one solution to evaluate, and it appears to be correct both theoretically and practically, we can conclude:

The best solution is <index>002</index> because:
1. It correctly solves all sample test cases
2. It handles the full input without any obvious errors
3. The algorithm is mathematically sound
4. It efficiently implements both the string generation and decoding counting requirements
5. It properly handles all the constraints including modulo arithmetic and lexicographical ordering

However, note that without other solutions to compare against, this conclusion is based solely on the correctness of this individual solution rather than a comparative analysis.
