Let me analyze each solution:

Solution 000:
- Sample input: Correct (Case #1: 2, Case #2: 3)
- Full input: No obviously wrong outputs. The counts appear reasonable and consistent.
- Algorithm: Uses twin primes and includes p=2 when N≥5, which matches the problem definition.

Solution 002:
- Sample input: Correct (Case #1: 2, Case #2: 3)
- Full input: No obviously wrong outputs. The counts match other solutions.
- Algorithm: Takes a different approach by checking small primes (2,3,5,7) and finding valid subtractorizations, but arrives at the same results.

Solution 001:
- Sample input: Correct (Case #1: 2, Case #2: 3)
- Full input: No obviously wrong outputs. The counts match other solutions.
- Algorithm: Similar to solution 000, using twin primes and including p=2 when N≥5.

Comparing algorithms:
- Solutions 000 and 001 use essentially the same approach: they count twin primes and add 1 for p=2 when N≥5. This is mathematically sound because:
  1. For p=2, we need 5-3=2 (requiring N≥5)
  2. For other primes, we need pairs of primes differing by 2 (twin primes)

- Solution 002 uses a different approach by checking specific small prime differences, but arrives at the same results. While correct, it's less elegant and potentially less efficient.

The best solution is <index>000</index> because:
1. It correctly handles all cases in both sample and full input
2. It uses an efficient sieve implementation with bytearray for memory efficiency
3. It has clear, well-structured code with good comments explaining the logic
4. It uses array module for efficient storage of twin prime counts
5. The algorithm is based on a solid mathematical understanding of the problem's properties
6. While solution 001 is very similar, solution 000 has better implementation details and optimizations
