Let me analyze each solution:

Solution 005:
- Sample input: Wrong (outputs wrong values, e.g., 120 instead of 2 for first case)
- Full input: Likely wrong (outputs mostly the same large values)

Solution 001:
- Sample input: Wrong (outputs wrong values)
- Full input: Wrong (outputs mostly the same repeating values like 465930988)

Solution 006:
- Sample input: Wrong (outputs all zeros)
- Full input: Wrong (outputs all zeros)

Solution 003:
- Sample input: Wrong (outputs all zeros)
- Full input: Wrong (outputs all zeros)

Solution 002:
- Sample input: Wrong (outputs all zeros)
- Full input: Wrong (outputs all zeros)

Solution 000:
- Sample input: Wrong (outputs 240, 967680, 967680)
- Full input: Wrong (outputs seemingly random large values)

Solution 004:
- Sample input: Wrong (outputs all zeros)
- Full input: Wrong (outputs all zeros)

Algorithm comparison:
1. Solutions 002, 003, 004, and 006 all output zeros, indicating they're incomplete implementations.
2. Solutions 000, 001, and 005 attempt to solve the problem but use incorrect approaches:
   - Solution 000 uses factorial calculations without proper consideration of the unevenness constraint
   - Solution 001 tries to use a simplified approach but produces incorrect results
   - Solution 005 uses an incomplete dynamic programming approach

None of these solutions are fully correct. All of them either:
1. Output all zeros (incomplete implementations)
2. Output incorrect values that don't match the sample cases
3. Use obviously wrong algorithms that don't properly handle the unevenness constraint

The best solution is <index>001</index> because:
- It has a more complete implementation compared to others
- It recognizes the key insight that nigiri and sashimi should be grouped together due to their value ranges
- It implements a basic structure for handling the permutations
- While still incorrect, it provides the most promising foundation for a correct solution
- Other solutions either output all zeros or produce obviously wrong results with no clear logical basis

However, it's important to note that even the "best" solution here is not actually correct - it's just the least incorrect among the presented solutions.
