The best solution among the presented options is:

**<index>001</index>**

This solution correctly handles the sample inputs, producing the expected outputs. Additionally, it demonstrates a thorough approach to assigning missing weights by grouping rabbits based on their shirt colors, ensuring uniqueness of weights, and minimizing the sum of \( F(c) \). The implementation efficiently assigns weights by prioritizing groups with known weights and carefully assigning available weights to minimize conflicts and maintain the constraints.

**Summary of Analysis:**

- **Correctness on Sample Inputs:** Solution `<index>001</index>` produces accurate results for all provided sample test cases, aligning perfectly with the expected outputs.
  
- **Handling of Full Inputs:** Although some solutions incorrectly output "No" for cases that should be "Yes," solution `<index>001</index>` maintains consistency and correctness across both sample and full inputs.

- **Algorithm and Implementation:** This solution employs a logical and efficient strategy by first addressing color groups with known weights and then handling those without, ensuring minimal \( F(c) \) and adherence to all constraints.

- **Output Consistency:** The outputs generated by this solution match the expected results for both sample and full inputs, indicating a high likelihood of full correctness.
