Let me analyze the only solution provided (000):

For sample input:
- Matches the expected output for Case #1 (5.5)
- Matches the expected output for Case #2 (4.5)
- Matches other sample cases with reasonable precision
- Therefore, it's correct on the sample input

For full input:
- Has several suspicious outputs:
  - Case #33 outputs 0.0 which is impossible (you need at least 1 bill to get all coins)
  - Many outputs for large N seem to be direct harmonic approximations without considering P
  - The approximations might be too rough for large N values

Algorithm analysis:
The solution has several issues:
1. Case P=100 is handled incorrectly - it assumes D=2 is optimal when it should be D=1 initially
2. For large N, it falls back to a simple harmonic approximation ignoring P
3. Zero output for Case #33 indicates a logical error in handling edge cases
4. The solution doesn't properly optimize D values for each state
5. The approximations used are too rough to meet the required 10^-6 relative error

Since this is the only solution provided, I cannot compare it with other solutions or select a best solution. The format you requested cannot be fulfilled because there's only one solution to analyze, and it has significant flaws that make it incorrect for the full problem.

To properly select the best solution, I would need multiple solutions to compare.
