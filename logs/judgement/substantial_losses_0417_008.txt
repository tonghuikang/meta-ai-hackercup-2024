Let me analyze each solution:

For sample input correctness:
- Solution 002: Correct sample output
- Solution 007: Correct sample output
- Solution 006: Correct sample output
- Solution 004: Correct sample output
- Solution 010: Correct sample output
- Solution 000: Correct sample output
- Solution 003: Correct sample output
- Solution 005: Correct sample output
- Solution 009: Correct sample output

For full input:
- All solutions produce identical outputs for the full input, and there are no obviously wrong outputs.

Algorithm comparison:
All solutions use the same core algorithm:
1. For L = 0: Expected days = W - G
2. For L > 0: Expected days = (W - G) Ã— (2L + 1)
3. All apply modulo 998244353 to handle large numbers

The solutions differ mainly in implementation details (input handling, variable naming, code organization) but not in the core algorithm. None of the solutions appear to be wrong as they:
- Handle the L = 0 case correctly
- Implement the correct formula for L > 0
- Apply modulo arithmetic properly
- Match on all inputs

The best solution is <index>004</index> because:
1. It has clear and efficient input handling using sys.stdin.read
2. It has good modular arithmetic implementation to prevent overflow
3. It includes clear documentation explaining the mathematical reasoning
4. It uses descriptive variable names
5. The code is well-organized and readable
6. It handles both the special case (L = 0) and general case (L > 0) efficiently
7. It follows good programming practices with proper function definitions and main guard

While all solutions are correct, solution 004 stands out for its balance of efficiency and readability.
