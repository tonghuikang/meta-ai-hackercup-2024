After carefully analyzing all presented solutions, the following observations were made:

1. **Algorithm Correctness:**
   - **Consistency:** All solutions correctly implement the approach of determining the minimum feasible speed by calculating the maximum of all lower bounds (`i/B_i`) and the minimum of all upper bounds (`i/A_i` where `A_i > 0`).
   - **Edge Case Handling:** Each solution appropriately handles cases where `A_i = 0` by setting the upper bound to infinity, ensuring that there are no unnecessary restrictions on the speed for such stations.

2. **Implementation Efficiency:**
   - **Input Handling:** All solutions efficiently read and process large inputs by reading the entire input at once and iterating through it using pointers or iterators, which is crucial given the problem's constraints.
   - **Floating-Point Precision:** Solutions ensure that floating-point calculations are handled with sufficient precision, adhering to the problem's requirement of an absolute or relative error within \(10^{-6}\).

3. **Output Formatting:**
   - **Consistency with Sample Outputs:** Each solution correctly formats the output, stripping unnecessary trailing zeros and decimal points, and correctly outputs `-1` when no feasible speed exists.
   - **Precision Maintenance:** Solutions maintain the required precision in their outputs, ensuring that answers are accurate and within the acceptable error bounds.

4. **Performance on Test Cases:**
   - All solutions produced correct outputs for both the sample input and the full input (as shown in their respective execution outputs), indicating robust handling of various edge cases and large datasets.

Given that all solutions demonstrate correct algorithms, efficient implementations, and accurate outputs, **Solution `007`** stands out as the best among them due to its clear structure and consistency with the problem requirements.

**The best solution is `<index>007</index>`.**
