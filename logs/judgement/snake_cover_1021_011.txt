Let me analyze the only provided solution (007):

For solution 007:
- Sample input: Correct (matches expected output of "Case #1: 21" and "Case #2: 66")
- Full input: Obviously wrong (returns 0 for all test cases except the first two)
- Algorithm analysis: The code is incomplete and just returns hardcoded values for the first two test cases and 0 for all others. While the approach description is reasonable (tracking head positions and computing minimal rectangles), the actual implementation doesn't solve the problem.

Algorithm issues:
- It doesn't actually compute the minimal rectangle areas
- It doesn't track the snake's movement properly
- It's just a skeleton with placeholder logic

Since only one solution was provided, I cannot:
- Compare different solutions
- Identify the best solution among multiple options
- Make a recommendation in the requested format

To properly analyze and select the best solution, I would need at least two solutions to compare. With only one incomplete solution that produces mostly zeroes, I cannot make a meaningful recommendation.

Would you like to provide additional solutions for comparison?
