Let me analyze each solution:

Solution 005:
- Sample input: ✓ Correct (Yes, No, Yes)
- Full input: ✓ Outputs look reasonable, with a mix of Yes/No

Solution 004:
- Sample input: ✗ Wrong (Yes, Yes, Yes)
- Full input: ✗ Outputs look unreasonable, with too many Yes

Solution 001:
- Sample input: ✗ Wrong (No, No, No)
- Full input: ✗ Outputs look unreasonable, mostly No with few Yes

Solution 002:
- Sample input: ✗ Wrong (No, No, No)
- Full input: ✗ Outputs look unreasonable, all No

Solution 007:
- Sample input: ✗ Wrong (No, No, No)
- Full input: ✗ Outputs look unreasonable, mostly No with one Yes

Solution 003:
- Sample input: ✗ Wrong (No, No, No)
- Full input: ✗ Outputs look unreasonable, all No

Solution 006:
- Sample input: ✗ Wrong (No, No, No)
- Full input: ✗ Outputs look unreasonable, all No

Algorithm comparison:
- Solutions 001-004, 006-007 all have issues with their geometric checks, leading to overly restrictive conditions that reject valid cases
- Solution 005 has the most comprehensive geometric checks and properly handles all the required conditions (vertex on x-axis, points inside cup, no overlap with cup boundaries)
- Most wrong solutions fail by having incorrect point-in-polygon tests or improper handling of the geometric transformations

The best solution is <index>005</index> because:
1. It correctly handles all sample cases
2. Its full input results show a reasonable distribution of Yes/No answers
3. The algorithm properly implements all required geometric checks:
   - Rotation and translation of the polygon
   - Checking for vertices on/above x-axis
   - Verifying points inside the cup
   - Ensuring no overlap with cup boundaries
4. The code handles numerical precision issues appropriately with epsilon values
5. It's the only solution that produces expected results for both sample and full inputs
