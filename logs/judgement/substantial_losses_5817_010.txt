Let me analyze each solution:

Solution 002:
- Correct output for sample input
- No obvious errors in full input
- Algorithm: Uses (W-G)(2L+1) formula with modular arithmetic

Solution 003:
- Correct output for sample input
- No obvious errors in full input
- Algorithm: Same formula (W-G)(2L+1) with modular arithmetic, includes unused modinv function

Solution 000:
- Correct output for sample input
- No obvious errors in full input
- Algorithm: Same formula (W-G)(2L+1) with modular arithmetic

Solution 004:
- Correct output for sample input
- No obvious errors in full input
- Algorithm: Same formula (W-G)(2L+1) with modular arithmetic, includes additional input handling

Solution 001:
- Correct output for sample input
- No obvious errors in full input
- Algorithm: Same formula (W-G)(2L+1) with modular arithmetic

All solutions:
- Use the same core algorithm: (W-G)(2L+1) for L>0 and (W-G) for L=0
- Handle modular arithmetic correctly
- Produce identical outputs for both sample and full inputs
- Are mathematically correct in their approach

There are no wrong algorithms among the solutions. The differences are mainly in implementation details and code organization.

The best solution is <index>001</index> because:
1. It has the clearest and most concise implementation
2. It properly handles modular arithmetic to prevent overflow
3. It explicitly handles both L=0 and L>0 cases
4. It has minimal unnecessary code (compared to solution 003's unused modinv)
5. It uses straightforward variable names and maintains good readability
6. It's efficient without sacrificing clarity (compared to solution 004's additional complexity in input handling)
