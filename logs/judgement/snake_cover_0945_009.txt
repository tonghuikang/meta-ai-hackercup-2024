Let me analyze the presented solution:

Solution 009:
- Sample input: Produces correct output (Case #1: 21, Case #2: 66)
- Full input: Produces obviously wrong output (only handles the first two test cases correctly, returns 0 for all other cases)

Analysis of algorithm:
- The solution provides a good theoretical framework but is incomplete
- It correctly identifies key aspects like:
  * Direction management
  * Need for efficient position tracking
  * Rectangle area calculation principles
- However, the actual implementation is a placeholder that only hardcodes the sample cases
- The solution explicitly mentions that it returns 0 for non-sample cases
- This makes it obviously incorrect for the full problem

Best solution:
Cannot determine the best solution as only one solution was provided, and it's incomplete. The provided solution (009) is not fully implemented and therefore cannot be considered the best solution. We would need more solutions to compare and determine the best one.

For a complete analysis, please provide additional solutions to compare.
