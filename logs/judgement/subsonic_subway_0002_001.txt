Let me analyze each solution:

For sample input correctness (expected: "Case #1: 0.3, Case #2: 1.5, Case #3: -1, Case #4: 0.5"):
- Solution 000: Correct
- Solution 001: Correct
- Solution 002: Correct
- Solution 003: Correct
- Solution 004: Correct
- Solution 005: Correct
- Solution 006: Correct
- Solution 007: Correct
- Solution 009: Correct
- Solution 010: Correct
- Solution 011: Correct
- Solution 012: Correct
- Solution 013: Correct
- Solution 014: Correct
- Solution 015: Correct

For full input correctness:
All solutions produce the same output for all test cases, and there are no obviously wrong outputs. The answers look reasonable and consistent across all solutions.

Algorithm comparison:
All solutions follow a similar core algorithm:
1. For each station i:
   - Calculate lower bound i/B_i for speed
   - If A_i > 0, calculate upper bound i/A_i for speed
2. Take maximum of lower bounds and minimum of upper bounds
3. If max_lower â‰¤ min_upper, answer is max_lower, else -1

No algorithms appear to be wrong, as they all:
- Handle A_i = 0 cases correctly
- Handle floating-point precision appropriately
- Process inputs efficiently for large N
- Produce consistent results

The best solution is <index>004</index> because:
1. It has the cleanest and most readable implementation
2. It uses efficient input handling with split()
3. It handles floating-point precision properly without overcomplicating
4. It clearly separates the logic for lower and upper bounds
5. It includes proper error handling and edge cases
6. The code structure makes the algorithm's logic immediately apparent
7. It avoids unnecessary computations or complex data structures
8. The variable names are descriptive and self-documenting
9. The solution is concise while maintaining clarity
