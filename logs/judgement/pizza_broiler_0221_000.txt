Let me analyze each solution:

Solution 000:
- Sample input: Wrong output for Case #1 (14 instead of 15) and Case #2 (40 instead of 41)
- Full input: Has output for all test cases, but given it's wrong on sample cases, it's likely wrong on full input too

Solution 001:
- Sample input: Wrong output for Case #1 (9 instead of 15) and Case #2 (35 instead of 41)
- Full input: Many test cases output 0, which is suspicious given all triangles must have some lattice points. This indicates the solution is incomplete/incorrect.

Comparing the algorithms:
1. Solution 000:
- Uses Pick's theorem for fully inside triangles
- Uses scanline approach for partially intersecting triangles
- Handles both cases but has implementation errors in counting

2. Solution 001:
- Uses Pick's theorem for fully inside triangles
- Explicitly skips partially intersecting triangles (outputs 0 contribution)
- Incomplete solution as stated in its own comments

Both solutions have flaws:
- Solution 000 has counting errors even though it implements both cases
- Solution 001 is incomplete and doesn't handle partial intersections at all

Neither solution is fully correct.

The best solution is: Neither solution is acceptable since both produce incorrect results. We would need a solution that:
1. Correctly handles both fully inside and partially intersecting triangles
2. Produces the correct output (15, 41) for the sample cases
3. Consistently handles all cases in the full input without suspicious patterns like many zeros

Given the available solutions, I cannot recommend either one as the best solution since both are demonstrably incorrect.
