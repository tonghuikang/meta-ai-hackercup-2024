1 3 3
1 1 2
1 4 12
1 2 3 4
2 2 5
1 2
2 1
2 3 17
1 1 2
1 2 2
2 2 5

2 1
```

#### **Breakdown of Test Cases:**

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - **Grid:** 1 row x 3 columns
   - **K:** 3
   - **Owner Grid:** [1, 1, 2]
   
   **Valid Hops:**
   - From (1,1) to (1,3): Owner 1 → 2, Score = 2
   - From (1,3) to (1,1): Owner 2 → 1, Score = 2
   - From (1,2) to (1,3): Owner 1 → 2, Score = 1
   - From (1,3) to (1,2): Owner 2 → 1, Score = 1

   **Sorted Scores:** [1, 1, 2, 2]

   **K-th Smallest (K=3):** 2

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - **Grid:** 1 row x 4 columns
   - **K:** 12
   - **Owner Grid:** [1, 2, 3, 4]
   
   **Valid Hops:** All ordered pairs since all owners are unique.
   
   **Number of Hops:** 4 * 3 = 12

   **Scores Range:** 1 to 3

   **K-th Smallest (K=12):** 3

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - **Grid:** 2 rows x 2 columns
   - **K:** 5
   - **Owner Grid:**
     ```
     1 2
     2 1
     ```
   
   **Valid Hops:**
   - Hops between different owners with scores computed accordingly.
   
   **After Calculation:** All valid hops have a score of 1.

   **K-th Smallest (K=5):** 1

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - **Grid:** 2 rows x 3 columns
   - **K:** 17
   - **Owner Grid:**
     ```
     1 1 2
     1 2 2
     ```
   
   **Valid Hops:** After calculating all possible ordered pairs with different owners, sorting their scores, and selecting the 17th smallest.

   **K-th Smallest (K=17):** 2

#### **Expected Sample Output:**
```
Case #1: 2
Case #2: 3
Case #3: 1
Case #4: 2
```

### Analyzing the Provided Solution (Solution ID: 000)

The provided solution employs a **binary search** approach to efficiently determine the K-th smallest score across all valid hops. Here's a brief analysis of its components:

1. **Binary Search Mechanism:**
   - **Range:** The search spans from `0` to `max(R, C)`, covering all possible score values.
   - **Counting Function (`count_less_equal`):** For a given score `S`, it counts all ordered hops with scores ≤ `S`.
   
2. **Counting Valid Hops:**
   - **Total Pairs Calculation:** It iterates through each cell, determining the number of cells within the score `S` distance.
   - **Same Owner Adjustment:** It subtracts pairs where both burrows have the same owner to ensure only different-owner hops are counted.
   
3. **Efficiency Considerations:**
   - **Data Structures:** Utilizes `defaultdict` to group burrows by their owners, facilitating quick access when adjusting for same-owner hops.
   - **Optimization:** Attempts to minimize computational overhead by avoiding unnecessary calculations, though certain optimizations (like prefix sums) might further enhance performance for large inputs.

4. **Correctness on Sample Input:**
   - **Execution Output:** The solution produces the following output for the sample input:
     ```
     Case #1: 2
     Case #2: 3
     Case #3: 1
     Case #4: 2
     ```
   - **Comparison with Expected Output:** The outputs match perfectly, indicating correct implementation for these cases.

### Summary of Findings

- **Algorithm Efficiency:** The binary search approach is suitable for large grids and multiple test cases, aligning with the problem's constraints.
- **Correctness:** The solution accurately handles the sample input, producing expected results.
- **Scalability:** While optimized for large inputs, there might be room for further enhancements (like advanced spatial partitioning) to handle edge cases more efficiently.
- **Reliability:** The consistent matching of sample outputs suggests a robust implementation.
