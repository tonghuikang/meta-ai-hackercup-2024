Algorithm Comparison:
All solutions follow the same core approach:
1. Find maximum lower bound (i/B_i)
2. Find minimum upper bound (i/A_i where A_i > 0)
3. Check if max_lower ≤ min_upper
4. Return max_lower if feasible, -1 if not

No algorithms appear to be fundamentally wrong, as they all:
- Handle A_i = 0 cases correctly
- Maintain required precision
- Process constraints properly

The best solution is <index>004</index> because:
1. It has the most robust implementation with threading support for large inputs
2. Handles all edge cases properly, including A_i = 0
3. Maintains consistent precision across all outputs
4. Has clear, well-structured code with proper error handling
5. Uses efficient input processing with sys.stdin.readline()
6. Includes comprehensive handling of floating-point comparison with appropriate tolerance
7. Has good balance between code readability and performance
