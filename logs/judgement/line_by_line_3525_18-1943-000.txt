Let me analyze each solution:

Solution 003:
- Sample input: Correct output, matches expected values
- Full input: No obviously wrong outputs, handles all cases correctly with appropriate precision

Solution 001:
- Sample input: Correct output, matches expected values
- Full input: No obviously wrong outputs, handles all cases correctly with appropriate precision

Solution 004:
- Sample input: Correct output, matches expected values
- Full input: No obviously wrong outputs, handles all cases correctly with appropriate precision

Solution 000:
- Sample input: Correct output, matches expected values
- Full input: No obviously wrong outputs, handles all cases correctly with appropriate precision

Solution 002:
- Sample input: Correct output, matches expected values
- Full input: No obviously wrong outputs, handles all cases correctly with appropriate precision

Algorithm comparison:
All solutions use the same core mathematical approach:
1. Calculate new probability P' = 100 * (P/100)^((N-1)/N)
2. Calculate increase as P' - P

No algorithms appear to be wrong. They differ mainly in implementation details:
- Error handling
- Precision handling
- Input processing
- Use of logarithms vs direct power calculation

The best solution is <index>003</index> because:
1. It has clear, well-structured code with good comments explaining the mathematical reasoning
2. It handles edge cases (P = 0) explicitly
3. It uses efficient input processing
4. It provides consistent precision in output
5. It includes thorough error handling
6. The implementation is more concise while maintaining readability compared to other solutions
7. It shows better organization of the mathematical logic with clear variable naming

While all solutions are correct, solution 003 stands out for its balance of robustness, clarity, and efficiency.
