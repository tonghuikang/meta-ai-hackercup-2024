- Full input: Values differ from correct solution

Solution #009:
- Sample input: Incorrect (got 110, 250 vs expected 21, 66) ✗
- Full input: Values appear much higher than expected

Solution #015:
- Sample input: Incorrect (got 88, 144 vs expected 21, 66) ✗
- Full input: Values appear inconsistent with correct solution

Comparing algorithms:
- Most solutions attempt to track the snake's head and tail positions
- Many solutions fail to correctly handle the minimum area calculation during moves
- Several solutions make incorrect assumptions about when the minimum area occurs
- Only solution #016 correctly handles both the sample and appears reasonable for the full input

The best solution is <index>016</index> because:
1. It's the only solution that correctly matches the sample input (21, 66)
2. Its approach of tracking head position and maintaining accurate min/max coordinates is mathematically sound
3. It properly handles direction changes and movement calculations
4. The full input results appear reasonable and consistent
5. It efficiently manages the snake's movement without trying to track every individual cell, which would be impractical given the constraints
6. Its implementation correctly calculates the minimal area during each move sequence
