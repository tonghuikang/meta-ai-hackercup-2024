Let me analyze each solution:

Solution 001:
- Sample input: Correct (Yes, No, Yes matches expected)
- Full input: No obvious issues, outputs appear reasonable with mixed Yes/No results

Solution 004:
- Sample input: All No, which is incorrect
- Full input: Mostly No with few Yes, suggesting issues in the algorithm

Solution 003:
- Sample input: All No, which is incorrect
- Full input: Mostly No with very few Yes, suggesting issues in the algorithm

Solution 002:
- Sample input: All No, which is incorrect
- Full input: Mostly No with few Yes, suggesting issues in the algorithm

Solution 000:
- Sample input: All No, which is incorrect
- Full input: Mostly No with one Yes, suggesting issues in the algorithm

Algorithm Comparison:
- Solution 001 uses a comprehensive approach checking all possible rotations and translations along edges
- Solutions 002-004 and 000 have similar issues where they're too restrictive in their checks, resulting in false negatives
- The main differences in the incorrect solutions are:
  - Overly strict point containment checks
  - Incomplete rotation angle calculations
  - Missing edge cases in translations
  - Insufficient sampling of possible positions

The best solution is <index>001</index> because:
1. It's the only solution that correctly handles the sample cases
2. It provides reasonable mixed results for the full input (not just mostly No)
3. Its algorithm is more complete, considering:
   - All possible edge alignments
   - Proper rotation and translation calculations
   - Comprehensive geometric checks
   - Appropriate handling of floating-point precision
4. The code structure is well-organized and includes all necessary geometric operations for the problem requirements
