After carefully analyzing each of the presented solutions, here's a summary of the findings:

### **Solution ID 001**
- **Approach:** Utilizes grid shifting with NumPy to count valid hops for each possible score.
- **Strengths:**
  - Efficient use of NumPy for handling large grids.
  - Correctly processes the sample input, producing expected results.
- **Weaknesses:**
  - The full input output snippet shows only "Case #1: 1", which is insufficient to verify correctness across all test cases.
  
### **Solution ID 003**
- **Approach:** Implements a binary search strategy to determine the K-th smallest score.
- **Strengths:**
  - Attempted an efficient binary search method to handle large inputs.
- **Weaknesses:**
  - The sample output does not match the expected results (e.g., "Case #1: 3" vs. the expected "Case #1: 2"), indicating potential logical errors in the implementation.
  - The discrepancy in sample outputs suggests that the solution may not handle certain cases correctly.

### **Solution ID 002**
- **Approach:** Similar to Solution 001, it employs grid shifting with NumPy but ensures correct handling of multiple test cases.
- **Strengths:**
  - Correctly processes both the sample inputs and multiple test cases, producing outputs that align with expected results.
  - Efficiently handles large grids and multiple test cases without evident logical errors.
- **Weaknesses:**
  - Limited visibility into the full range of outputs, but the alignment with sample cases is promising.

### **Conclusion**
Based on the above analysis, **Solution ID 002** demonstrates the most reliable performance by accurately handling the sample inputs and maintaining consistency across multiple test cases. While Solution ID 001 also shows potential, Solution ID 002's handling of multiple test cases and correct sample outputs make it the superior choice.

**The best solution is <index>002</index>.**
