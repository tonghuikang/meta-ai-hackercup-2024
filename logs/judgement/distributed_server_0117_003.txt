Let me analyze each solution:

Solution 000:
- Sample input: Incorrect. For case #1, outputs "meta" instead of expected "meta", for case #2 outputs "haczdr" instead of "hacker", for case #3 is correct with "cup"
- Full input: Shows inconsistency with the problem constraints as it's not properly handling robot conflicts and movement restrictions

Solution 001:
- Sample input: Incorrect. For case #1 outputs "meta", for case #2 outputs "haczdr" instead of "hacker", case #3 is correct
- Full input: The outputs are too long in many cases and don't properly account for robot movement restrictions

Solution 002:
- Sample input: Wrong. For case #1 outputs "m", for case #2 outputs "h", for case #3 outputs "c" - all are truncated versions of the expected answers
- Full input: Many answers are too short (single characters) which indicates it's not properly exploring all possible paths

Comparing the algorithms:
- Solution 000 uses a greedy approach trying to maximize each robot's path independently
- Solution 001 uses a similar greedy approach but with more complex path planning
- Solution 002 uses BFS with character-by-character construction

All three solutions appear to be incorrect, but for different reasons:
- Solutions 000 and 001 don't properly handle robot conflicts
- Solution 002 stops too early in its string construction
- None of them correctly implement the requirement that robots can move independently and deactivate when needed

Since all solutions presented are incorrect, I cannot identify a "best" solution. The main issues are:
1. Not properly handling robot conflicts
2. Not correctly implementing the movement and deactivation rules
3. Not finding the true lexicographically maximum possible value of min(S_i)

A correct solution would need to:
1. Properly handle robot conflicts
2. Consider all possible movement combinations
3. Allow robots to deactivate when optimal
4. Find the true lexicographically maximum possible value of min(S_i)

Therefore, I cannot recommend any of these solutions as the best solution.
