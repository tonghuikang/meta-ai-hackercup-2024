Let me analyze each solution:

Solution 006:
- Correct output for sample input
- No obviously wrong outputs for full input
- Uses the formula (W-G)*(2L+1)

Solution 004:
- Correct output for sample input
- No obviously wrong outputs for full input
- Uses the same formula (W-G)*(2L+1)

Solution 000:
- Correct output for sample input
- No obviously wrong outputs for full input
- Uses the same formula (W-G)*(2L+1)

Solution 001:
- Correct output for sample input
- No obviously wrong outputs for full input
- Uses the same formula (W-G)*(2L+1)

Solution 002:
- Correct output for sample input
- No obviously wrong outputs for full input
- Uses the same formula (W-G)*(2L+1)

Solution 003:
- Correct output for sample input
- No obviously wrong outputs for full input
- Uses the same formula (W-G)*(2L+1)

Algorithm comparison:
All solutions actually implement the same core algorithm using the formula (W-G)*(2L+1) with modulo arithmetic. The main differences are in:
- Input handling
- Variable naming
- Code organization
- Comments and documentation
None of the algorithms appear to be wrong as they all produce identical outputs and use the same mathematical foundation.

The best solution is <index>006</index> because:
1. It has the most comprehensive explanation of the mathematical reasoning behind the solution
2. It clearly explains each component of the formula and why it works
3. It handles edge cases explicitly (L=0 case)
4. The code is well-commented and organized
5. It includes verification against sample inputs in the explanation
6. It carefully handles the modular arithmetic operations to prevent overflow

While all solutions are technically correct, solution 006 provides the best documentation and explanation making it the most maintainable and understandable implementation.
