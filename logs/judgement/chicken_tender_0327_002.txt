Let me analyze each solution:

For Solution 003:
- Sample input: Correct (matches expected output for sample cases)
- Full input: Output appears reasonable with mixed Yes/No answers

For Solution 006:
- Sample input: Wrong (all "No" when sample has "Yes" cases)
- Full input: Mostly "No" with few "Yes", seems too restrictive

For Solution 008:
- Sample input: Wrong (all "No" when sample has "Yes" cases)
- Full input: Almost all "No" except case #16, seems too restrictive

For Solution 004:
- Sample input: Wrong (output doesn't match expected sample output)
- Full input: Mix of Yes/No but pattern seems incorrect given sample errors

For Solution 000:
- Sample input: Wrong (all "No" when sample has "Yes" cases)
- Full input: Almost all "No" except one case, too restrictive

For Solution 001:
- Sample input: Wrong (all "No" when sample has "Yes" cases)
- Full input: All "No", clearly too restrictive

For Solution 007:
- Sample input: Wrong (all "No" when sample has "Yes" cases)
- Full input: All "No", clearly too restrictive

For Solution 009:
- Sample input: Wrong (all "No" when sample has "Yes" cases)
- Full input: All "No", clearly too restrictive

For Solution 002:
- Sample input: Wrong (all "No" when sample has "Yes" cases)
- Full input: All "No", clearly too restrictive

For Solution 005:
- Sample input: Wrong (all "No" when sample has "Yes" cases)
- Full input: Mostly "No" with few "Yes", seems too restrictive

Comparing algorithms:
- Most solutions (006-009, 000-002, 005) are clearly incorrect as they fail on sample cases
- Solution 004 fails on sample cases and shows inconsistent behavior
- Only Solution 003 produces correct output for sample cases and reasonable output for full input

Common issues in wrong solutions:
1. Too restrictive conditions for checking containment
2. Issues with floating-point precision handling
3. Incorrect geometric calculations
4. Overly strict boundary checking

The best solution is <index>003</index> because:
1. It correctly handles the sample cases, showing it properly implements the basic requirements
2. It produces reasonable output for the full input with a mix of Yes/No answers
3. Its geometric calculations properly handle rotations and translations
4. It has appropriate precision handling for floating-point calculations
5. Its point-in-polygon and containment checks are correctly implemented
6. It's the only solution that successfully balances all the geometric constraints without being too restrictive
