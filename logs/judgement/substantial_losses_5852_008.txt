Let me analyze each solution:

Solution 005:
- Correct output for sample input
- No obviously wrong output for full input
- Uses formula (W-G)*(2L+1)

Solution 000:
- Correct output for sample input
- No obviously wrong output for full input
- Uses formula (W-G)*(2L+1)

Solution 004:
- Correct output for sample input
- No obviously wrong output for full input
- Uses formula (W-G)*(2L+1)

Solution 002:
- Correct output for sample input
- No obviously wrong output for full input
- Uses formula (W-G)*(2L+1)

Solution 001:
- Correct output for sample input
- No obviously wrong output for full input
- Uses formula (W-G)*(2L+1)

Comparing algorithms:
- All solutions use the same core formula: (W-G)*(2L+1)
- All handle the L=0 case correctly
- All handle modular arithmetic correctly
- The main differences are in code organization and handling of large numbers
- No obviously wrong algorithms were identified

The best solution is <index>002</index> because:
1. It has the most robust input handling using sys.stdin.readline() which is more efficient for large inputs
2. It explicitly handles modular arithmetic in steps (calculating delta_mod and factor separately) which helps prevent potential overflow issues
3. It has clear variable names and organization making the code more maintainable
4. It's structured in a main() function which is good programming practice
5. It includes proper system imports and error handling considerations
6. While all solutions are functionally correct, this one has the best balance of efficiency and code quality
