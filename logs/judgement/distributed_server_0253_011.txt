Let me analyze each solution:

Solution 007:
- Sample input: Wrong (outputs "m", "h", "c" instead of "meta", "hacker", "cup")
- Full input: Multiple wrong outputs, too short strings compared to other solutions

Solution 001:
- Sample input: Wrong (outputs "meta", "haczdr", "cup" - incorrect for case 2)
- Full input: Some strings appear shorter than optimal solutions

Solution 005:
- Sample input: Wrong (outputs "meta", "haczdr", "cup" - incorrect for case 2)
- Full input: Pattern similar to 001, likely has the same flaw

Solution 003:
- Sample input: Wrong (outputs "qdmexa", "zhaczdr", "mhcup" - all incorrect)
- Full input: Outputs appear inconsistent with other solutions

Solution 000:
- Sample input: Wrong (outputs empty strings)
- Full input: Many empty strings, clearly incorrect

Solution 004:
- Sample input: Wrong (outputs "a", "aa", "cc" - all incorrect)
- Full input: Strings appear too short compared to other solutions

Solution 006:
- Sample input: Wrong (outputs "m", "hac", "cu" - all incorrect)
- Full input: Strings appear too short

Solution 002:
- Sample input: Correct! (outputs "meta", "hacker", "cup")
- Full input: Outputs are consistently longer and lexicographically larger compared to other solutions

Comparing algorithms:
- Solutions 000, 004, 006, 007 use overly simplified approaches that fail to handle robot conflicts properly
- Solutions 001, 003, 005 attempt to handle conflicts but have flaws in their path selection
- Solution 002 uses a correct approach by:
  1. Finding lexicographically highest possible paths for each robot
  2. Taking the minimum among these paths
  3. Properly handling the constraints of robot movement

The best solution is <index>002</index> because:
1. It's the only solution that produces correct output for the sample cases
2. Its algorithm correctly implements the problem requirements by maximizing the lexicographical minimum of all possible robot paths
3. The implementation properly handles all constraints (robot movement, grid boundaries)
4. It produces consistent and reasonable outputs for the full input
5. The algorithm is efficient, using a combination of BFS and greedy approach to find optimal paths
