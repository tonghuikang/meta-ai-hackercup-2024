After carefully reviewing all the presented solutions, here's the analysis:

### **Solution Analysis**

1. **Solution ID 000**
   - **Issue:** The output for the first test case (`Case #1: 112 116`) does not match the expected sample output (`Case #1: 122 3`). This indicates a flaw in both the decoding logic and the way corrupted characters are handled.
   
2. **Solution ID 001**
   - **Strengths:**
     - **Correctness:** The output matches the sample input perfectly. For example, `Case #1: 122 3` aligns with the expected output.
     - **Comprehensive Handling:** The solution effectively uses dynamic programming to maximize decodings and correctly identifies the lexicographically \(K\)th largest string.
     - **Efficiency:** It accounts for large inputs by implementing optimizations and handles edge cases gracefully.
   - **Conclusion:** This solution accurately solves the problem as per the given specifications and sample tests.

3. **Solution ID 003**
   - **Issue:** The output for the first test case (`Case #1: 972 116`) does not match the expected sample, indicating incorrect handling of corrupted characters and decoding logic.
   
4. **Solution ID 006**
   - **Issue:** Similar to Solution ID 000 and 003, the output does not align with the expected sample results (`Case #1: 222 116` vs. `Case #1: 122 3`), showcasing flawed implementation.
   
5. **Solution ID 009**
   - **Issue:** The first test case output (`Case #1: 972 116`) deviates from the expected result, pointing to inaccuracies in decoding and corrupted character replacement.

### **Conclusion**

Among all the solutions, **Solution ID 001** stands out as the most accurate and reliable. It successfully passes the sample tests and adheres to the problem constraints, making it the best choice.

**The best solution is `<index>001</index>`.**
