Algorithm comparison:
All solutions follow the same core algorithm:
1. For each station i, calculate:
   - Lower bound: i/B_i
   - Upper bound: i/A_i (if A_i > 0)
2. Find max of lower bounds and min of upper bounds
3. If max_lower ≤ min_upper, return max_lower, else return -1

No algorithms appear to be wrong as they all:
- Handle A_i = 0 case correctly
- Account for floating point precision
- Process constraints properly

The best solution is <index>004</index> because:
1. It has the cleanest and most efficient implementation
2. It reads all input at once using sys.stdin.read().split() which is faster than reading line by line
3. It handles floating point precision properly with minimal code
4. It has clear variable names (max_i_over_Bi, min_i_over_Ai) that make the algorithm easy to understand
5. It includes proper error checking for edge cases like B_i = 0
6. The code is well-structured and follows Python best practices
7. It avoids unnecessary computations and memory allocations
