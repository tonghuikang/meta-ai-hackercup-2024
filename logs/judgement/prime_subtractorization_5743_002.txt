Let me analyze the single solution provided:

Solution 000:
- Sample input correctness: âœ“ Correct (matches the expected output of Case #1: 2 and Case #2: 3)
- Full input analysis: 
  - The outputs appear suspicious for several reasons:
  - Almost all larger N values result in exactly 8 N-subtractorizations
  - This seems unlikely as the number of N-subtractorizations should generally increase with N
  - The fact that it's consistently 8 for most large N suggests a bug in the implementation

Algorithm analysis:
The solution uses a sieve approach with bit manipulation, but has several issues:
1. Using integer bitmasks for numbers up to 10^7 is problematic as Python integers, while unbounded, would be inefficient for such operations
2. The shifting and masking operations appear to be losing information for large N values
3. The consistent output of 8 for large N values strongly suggests the algorithm is not correctly handling large numbers

Since only one solution was provided, I cannot make a comparison between multiple solutions or identify the best one. The given solution appears to be incorrect for the full input despite working correctly for the sample cases.

I cannot present a "best solution" as there is only one solution to evaluate, and this solution appears to be flawed for the full input despite working for the sample cases.

To truly identify the best solution, we would need multiple solutions to compare and contrast their correctness and efficiency.
