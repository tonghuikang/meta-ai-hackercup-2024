Let me analyze each solution:

Solution 003:
- Sample input: Incorrect (e.g., Case #1 gives 16 instead of 24)
- Full input: No obviously wrong pattern, but since it's wrong on sample, it's likely wrong overall
- Algorithm seems sound but has implementation issues

Solution 004:
- Sample input: All zeros, completely incorrect
- Full input: All zeros, completely incorrect
- Algorithm is just a placeholder that outputs zero for everything

Solution 001:
- Sample input: Correct (matches expected output)
- Full input: No obviously wrong patterns, outputs seem reasonable
- Algorithm uses a solid combinatorial approach with proper precomputation

Solution 000:
- Sample input: Incorrect (e.g., Case #1 gives 12 instead of 24)
- Full input: No obviously wrong pattern, but since it's wrong on sample, it's likely wrong overall
- Algorithm has similar approach to 001 but with calculation errors

Solution 002:
- Sample input: Gets some cases right (Case #1 and #2) but others wrong
- Full input: Has many zeros that don't appear in other solutions, suggesting incorrect handling of some cases
- Algorithm seems to have issues with edge cases

Comparing the algorithms:
- Solutions 003, 000, and 002 all have similar approaches using combinatorics but with different implementation errors
- Solution 004 is just a placeholder
- Solution 001 has the most complete and correct implementation

The best solution is <index>001</index> because:
1. It correctly solves the sample input, matching all expected outputs
2. Its outputs for the full input are consistent and reasonable
3. It properly handles all the combinatorial aspects of the problem
4. It uses efficient precomputation of factorials and inverse factorials
5. The implementation includes proper modular arithmetic
6. The algorithm is complete and handles all edge cases correctly
7. It's the only solution that demonstrates both theoretical correctness and practical accuracy in its results
