Let's analyze the only provided solution (index 000):

Sample Input Analysis:
- The solution matches exactly with the expected output for all 6 sample cases.
- It correctly handles various scenarios including corrupted digits, single digit cases, and longer strings.

Full Input Analysis:
- The solution provides reasonable outputs for all cases.
- The outputs satisfy the constraints:
  - All outputs are valid strings (no invalid digits)
  - The second number in each output is within modulo 998,244,353
  - The string lengths match input requirements
- No obvious anomalies or incorrect patterns are visible in the outputs.

Algorithm Analysis:
The solution uses a sound approach:
1. For each '?' position, strategically assigns '1' or '2' to maximize decoding possibilities
2. Uses K to determine the lexicographically Kth largest string
3. Uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible decodings
4. The algorithm correctly handles leading zeros and valid number constraints (1-26)

Since there is only one solution provided, I can't compare it with others. However, this solution appears to be correct because:
- It produces correct results for all sample cases
- The algorithm is mathematically sound
- The outputs for the full input are reasonable and within constraints
- It efficiently handles the size constraints of the problem

The best solution is <index>000</index> because:
- It correctly solves all sample cases
- It uses an efficient dynamic programming approach
- It properly handles the lexicographical ordering requirement
- It correctly implements the modulo arithmetic
- The outputs for the full input appear valid and reasonable
- There are no obvious edge cases where it fails

Note: Without other solutions to compare against, we can only verify this solution's correctness on its own merits, which it appears to satisfy.
