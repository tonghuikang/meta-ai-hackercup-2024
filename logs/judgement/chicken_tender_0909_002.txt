Let me analyze each solution:

For Sample Input:
Expected: Yes, No, Yes

Solution 004: Yes, No, Yes (Correct)
Solution 008: No, No, No (Wrong)
Solution 009: No, No, No (Wrong)
Solution 014: No, No, No (Wrong)
Solution 001: No, No, No (Wrong)
Solution 015: No, No, No (Wrong)
Solution 005: No, No, No (Wrong)
Solution 007: No, No, No (Wrong)
Solution 010: No, No, No (Wrong)
Solution 011: No, No, No (Wrong)
Solution 012: No, No, No (Wrong)
Solution 013: No, No, No (Wrong)
Solution 000: No, No, No (Wrong)
Solution 006: No, No, No (Wrong)

For Full Input:
Only Solution 004 produces a reasonable mix of Yes/No answers that aligns with the problem constraints. All other solutions appear to be overly restrictive, producing mostly "No" answers.

Algorithm Comparison:
- Solution 004 uses a comprehensive approach that:
  * Correctly handles rotation of edges
  * Properly validates all constraints
  * Uses appropriate epsilon values for floating-point comparisons
  * Correctly implements point-in-polygon tests

- Other solutions have various issues:
  * Many solutions fail to properly handle edge cases
  * Some solutions are too restrictive in their geometric checks
  * Many have incorrect implementation of rotation/translation operations
  * Several have numerical precision issues

The best solution is <index>004</index> because:
1. It's the only solution that correctly solves the sample input
2. It produces reasonable results for the full input with a mix of Yes/No answers
3. It implements all the required geometric checks correctly
4. It handles floating-point precision appropriately
5. Its approach of checking each edge for rotation and validating all constraints is mathematically sound and complete
6. The implementation is robust and handles all edge cases properly

The other solutions appear to have implementation flaws that make them too restrictive, causing them to incorrectly reject valid cases. Solution 004 stands out as the most complete and correct implementation of the required algorithm.
