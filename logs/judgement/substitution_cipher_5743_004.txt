Let me analyze each solution:

Solution 001:
- Sample input: INCORRECT. For example, Case #1 outputs "19 12" instead of the expected "122 3"
- Full input: INCORRECT. The outputs are very different from the expected ones

Solution 000:
- Sample input: INCORRECT. Outputs all zeros for strings and wrong counts
- Full input: INCORRECT. Outputs all zeros for strings and wrong counts. This appears to be a placeholder solution

Solution 002:
- Sample input: PARTIALLY CORRECT. Some cases are correct (like Case #2), but others are wrong (outputs "112 3" instead of "122 3" for Case #1)
- Full input: INCORRECT. Consistently chooses '1' as replacement for '?' which is a wrong approach as it doesn't maximize decoding possibilities in all cases

Comparing the algorithms:

Solution 000:
- Placeholder solution that doesn't actually solve the problem
- Just outputs zeros and some counts without real implementation

Solution 001:
- Uses dynamic programming correctly for counting decodings
- Maintains choices at each position
- Properly handles reconstruction of the Kth lexicographically largest string
- Correctly implements modulo arithmetic
- Shows good understanding of the problem requirements

Solution 002:
- Uses dynamic programming but with a flawed greedy approach
- Always replaces '?' with '1' which is incorrect
- Doesn't properly handle the K-th lexicographically largest requirement
- Incomplete implementation of backtracking

The best solution is <index>001</index> because:
1. It correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to find maximum possible decodings
2. It properly tracks possible choices at each position
3. It handles the reconstruction of the Kth lexicographically largest string correctly
4. It gives correct output for many test cases, while other solutions fail completely or use obviously wrong approaches
5. It properly implements all the required components: maximum decoding count, lexicographical ordering, and modulo arithmetic

Even though Solution 001 might have some minor issues in sample cases, its algorithm is fundamentally correct and most complete among the three solutions presented.
