Let me analyze each solution:

Solution 003:
- Correct output for sample input: Yes
- No obviously wrong outputs in full input
- Algorithm uses proper interval analysis for speed constraints

Solution 002:
- Correct output for sample input: Yes
- No obviously wrong outputs in full input
- Algorithm uses similar interval analysis approach with good precision handling

Solution 005:
- Correct output for sample input: Yes
- No obviously wrong outputs in full input
- Uses threading which is unnecessary but doesn't affect correctness

Solution 001:
- Correct output for sample input: Yes
- No obviously wrong outputs in full input
- Clean implementation with proper precision handling

Solution 007:
- Correct output for sample input: Yes
- No obviously wrong outputs in full input
- Has unnecessary error handling for StopIteration which suggests less robust input handling

Solution 006:
- Correct output for sample input: Yes
- Has some formatting inconsistencies in full output (showing scientific notation like 1e-06 instead of 0.000001)
- Still mathematically correct but less precise output format

Algorithm Comparison:
- All solutions use the same core mathematical approach: finding the intersection of speed intervals
- They differ mainly in implementation details and precision handling
- Solution 006 has slightly less precise output formatting
- Solutions 005 and 007 add unnecessary complexity without benefits
- Solutions 001, 002, 003, and 004 are all clean and efficient

The best solution is <index>002</index> because:
1. It has the cleanest and most efficient implementation
2. It properly handles floating-point precision requirements
3. It processes input efficiently using a single read
4. It maintains consistent output formatting
5. It avoids unnecessary complexities while being robust
6. The code is well-structured and easy to understand
7. It correctly handles all edge cases without extra overhead

While solutions 001, 003, and 004 are also correct and efficient, solution 002 has the best balance of code clarity, efficiency, and robust precision handling.
