Let me analyze each solution step by step:

For each solution:
- Solution 000: Correct sample output, consistent full output, no obvious errors
- Solution 001: Correct sample output, consistent full output, no obvious errors
- Solution 002: Correct sample output, consistent full output, no obvious errors
- Solution 003: Correct sample output, consistent full output, no obvious errors
- Solution 004: Correct sample output, consistent full output, no obvious errors
- Solution 005: Correct sample output, consistent full output, no obvious errors
- Solution 006: Correct sample output, consistent full output, no obvious errors
- Solution 007: Correct sample output, consistent full output, no obvious errors
- Solution 008: Correct sample output, consistent full output, no obvious errors
- Solution 009: Correct sample output, consistent full output, no obvious errors
- Solution 010: Correct sample output, consistent full output, no obvious errors
- Solution 011: Correct sample output, consistent full output, no obvious errors
- Solution 012: Correct sample output, consistent full output, no obvious errors
- Solution 013: Correct sample output, consistent full output, no obvious errors
- Solution 014: Correct sample output, consistent full output, no obvious errors
- Solution 016: Correct sample output, consistent full output, no obvious errors

Algorithm comparison:
- All solutions follow the same core algorithm:
  1. Find maximum lower bound: max(i/B_i)
  2. Find minimum upper bound: min(i/A_i) where A_i > 0
  3. If max_lower â‰¤ min_upper, return max_lower; else return -1
- Main differences are in:
  - Input processing efficiency
  - Precision handling
  - Edge case handling
  - Code organization

No obviously wrong algorithms were identified - all solutions produce consistent results.

The best solution is <index>004</index> because:
1. It has the most efficient input processing using sys.stdin.read() and split() once
2. It handles floating-point precision well with a small epsilon (1e-12)
3. It's concise yet clear, making it easy to maintain
4. It properly handles edge cases (A_i = 0)
5. The code structure is well-organized with clear variable names
6. It avoids unnecessary computations and memory allocations
7. It uses optimal data structures (simple variables instead of lists)

This solution strikes the best balance between efficiency, readability, and robustness.
