Let me analyze each solution:

Solution 000:
- Sample input: Incorrect. Different from expected output (e.g., Case #1: 16 vs expected 24)
- Full input: No obviously wrong outputs, but since it's incorrect on sample, it's likely incorrect overall

Solution 002:
- Sample input: Completely wrong. Returns all zeros
- Full input: Returns all zeros, which is obviously wrong since not all cases should be zero

Solution 001:
- Sample input: Some differences from expected output (e.g., Case #1: 16 vs expected 24)
- Full input: No obviously wrong outputs, but likely incorrect since sample output is wrong

Comparing the algorithms:
- Solution 000 uses a combinatorial approach with dynamic programming and precomputed binomial coefficients
- Solution 002 is incomplete and just returns zeros
- Solution 001 uses generating functions and combinatorial analysis with precomputed factorials

Wrong algorithms identified:
- Solution 002 is clearly wrong as it just returns zeros
- Solutions 000 and 001 both have incorrect outputs for the sample cases, suggesting their underlying logic has flaws

None of the presented solutions are fully correct as they all fail to produce the expected output for the sample input. Therefore, I cannot recommend any of them as the best solution. The correct solution would need to:
1. Match the exact expected output for the sample cases
2. Handle edge cases properly
3. Produce reasonable outputs for the full input
4. Have correct mathematical reasoning for calculating the number of possible original strings

In this case, none of the solutions meet these criteria, so there is no best solution among the presented options.
