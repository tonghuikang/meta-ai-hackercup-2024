Let me analyze each solution:

Solution 000:
- Sample input: INCORRECT
  - First case should be 24, but outputs 16
  - Third case should be 992573627, but outputs 519900361
  - Fourth case should be 590806193, but outputs 81243131
  - Fifth case should be 33750000, but outputs 26250000
- Full input: Cannot determine obvious wrongness, but since it fails sample cases, it's likely incorrect
- Algorithm: Tries to use combinatorics and dynamic programming but has errors in counting that lead to wrong results

Solution 001:
- Sample input: INCORRECT (outputs all zeros)
- Full input: INCORRECT (outputs all zeros)
- Algorithm: This is just a placeholder solution that outputs zero for all cases. The code includes extensive comments about possible approaches but doesn't actually implement any of them.

Comparing and contrasting:
- Solution 000 attempts to solve the problem properly with combinatorics and dynamic programming but has implementation errors that lead to incorrect results
- Solution 001 is just a placeholder that outputs zeros and doesn't actually attempt to solve the problem

Neither solution is correct.

The best solution is Neither (Reasoning: Both presented solutions are incorrect. Solution 000 produces wrong answers for the sample cases, indicating fundamental flaws in its implementation. Solution 001 is just a placeholder that outputs zeros for all cases. We would need at least one solution that correctly handles both sample and full inputs to identify a "best" solution.)
