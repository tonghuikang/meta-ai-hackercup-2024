Let me analyze each solution:

For sample input correctness (comparing with expected output):
- 014: Correct
- 003: Correct
- 006: Correct
- 009: Correct
- 000: Correct
- 013: Correct
- 007: Correct
- 005: Correct
- 012: Correct
- 001: Correct
- 008: Correct
- 002: Correct
- 010: Correct
- 004: Correct

For full input:
- All solutions produce similar outputs with consistent patterns of -1's and decimal values
- No solution shows obviously wrong output patterns

Algorithm comparison:
All solutions follow a similar core algorithm:
1. For each station i:
   - Calculate lower bound i/B_i
   - Calculate upper bound i/A_i (when A_i > 0)
2. Find maximum of lower bounds and minimum of upper bounds
3. If max_lower â‰¤ min_upper, output max_lower, else output -1

However, they differ in:
- Input handling (readline vs read().split())
- Precision handling
- Edge case handling (especially A_i = 0)
- Error tolerance checking

No algorithm appears fundamentally wrong, as they all implement the same mathematical logic correctly.

The best solution is <index>003</index> because:
1. It has clean, well-organized code with clear variable names and logical structure
2. It uses efficient input reading with sys.stdin.readline()
3. It properly handles all edge cases, especially A_i = 0
4. It includes appropriate error tolerance (1e-6)
5. It's the most straightforward implementation of the algorithm without unnecessary complexity
6. The code is well-documented with clear explanations of the mathematical reasoning
7. It effectively handles floating-point precision issues without over-complicating the solution

The solution strikes the right balance between efficiency, readability, and correctness, making it the most maintainable and reliable implementation.
