Let me analyze each solution:

Solution 000:
- Sample input: Correct output (matches expected output)
- Full input: Successfully executed, no obviously wrong outputs
- Algorithm: Uses formula E = (W - G) × (2L + 1)

Solution 001:
- Sample input: Correct output (matches expected output)
- Full input: Successfully executed, no obviously wrong outputs
- Algorithm: Uses formula E = (W - G) × (2L + 1) with special case for L = 0

Solution 003:
- Sample input: Correct output (matches expected output)
- Full input: Successfully executed, no obviously wrong outputs
- Algorithm: Uses formula E = (W - G) × (2L + 1) with special case for L = 0

Comparing the algorithms:
- All three solutions use essentially the same formula: E = (W - G) × (2L + 1)
- Solutions 001 and 003 handle L = 0 as a special case, though it's not necessary since the formula still works when L = 0
- All solutions handle modular arithmetic correctly
- None of the algorithms appear to be wrong

The best solution is <index>000</index> because:
1. It correctly solves both sample and full inputs
2. It has the simplest implementation without unnecessary special cases
3. It has clear code organization and comments explaining the mathematical reasoning
4. It handles large numbers correctly with modular arithmetic
5. It's more efficient by not having extra conditional branches for L = 0

While all solutions are correct, solution 000 achieves the same result with cleaner, more straightforward code and better documentation of the mathematical reasoning behind the solution.
