Algorithm Analysis:
- Most solutions incorrectly handle the area calculation during snake movement
- Common errors include:
  - Not properly tracking the snake's minimum area during moves
  - Incorrect handling of tail movement
  - Wrong bounding box calculations
  - Improper direction changes

The best solution is <index>013</index> because:
1. It has the most complete analysis of the problem requirements
2. Although it returns 0 for all cases (incomplete implementation), it correctly identifies all the key components needed for a solution:
   - Proper snake representation
   - Efficient head and tail tracking
   - Accurate bounding rectangle calculation
   - Sliding window technique for position tracking
   - Detailed consideration of the constraints

None of the solutions presented are fully correct, as they all fail to produce the correct output for the sample cases. However, solution 013 provides the best theoretical framework for a correct implementation, even though it lacks the final implementation details.
