Let me analyze each solution:

Solution 000:
- Sample input: Incorrect (outputs 120, 6720, 40320 vs expected 2, 288, 33984)
- Full input: Obviously wrong as it's generating much larger numbers than expected, likely due to not properly checking the unevenness constraint

Solution 001:
- Sample input: Incorrect (outputs all zeros)
- Full input: Obviously wrong (outputs all zeros)
- The solution is incomplete and returns placeholder zeros

Solution 002:
- Sample input: Incorrect (outputs all zeros)
- Full input: Obviously wrong (outputs all zeros)
- The solution is incomplete and returns placeholder zeros

Solution 003:
- Sample input: Matches expected output (2, 288, 33984)
- Full input: No obviously wrong patterns, outputs varying numbers that seem reasonable given the problem constraints

Solution 004:
- Sample input: Incorrect (outputs all zeros)
- Full input: Obviously wrong (outputs all zeros)
- The solution is incomplete and returns placeholder zeros

Comparing algorithms:
- Solutions 001, 002, and 004 are incomplete implementations returning placeholder zeros
- Solution 000 implements a faulty approach that doesn't properly check the unevenness constraint
- Solution 003 implements a correct approach by:
  1. Considering only arrangements where nigiri and sashimi are grouped together
  2. Checking both possible arrangements (nigiri-then-sashimi and sashimi-then-nigiri)
  3. Properly calculating unevenness scores and factorials for valid arrangements

The best solution is <index>003</index> because:
1. It's the only solution that correctly matches the sample output
2. It uses a valid algorithmic approach by exploiting the key insight that minimal unevenness scores occur when nigiri and sashimi are grouped together (due to their vastly different value ranges)
3. It efficiently handles the constraints by calculating factorials and considering only feasible arrangements
4. It produces reasonable outputs for the full input, without obvious patterns that would indicate incorrectness
5. It's a complete implementation that properly handles all cases, unlike the other solutions which are incomplete or incorrect
