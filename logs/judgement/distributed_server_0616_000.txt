Let me analyze each solution:

Solution 005:
- Sample input: CORRECT (matches expected output)
- Full input: No obviously wrong output, consistent patterns in sequences

Solution 008:
- Sample input: WRONG (first case: hac vs meta)
- Full input: Some outputs seem too long and complex, might be incorrect

Solution 002:
- Sample input: WRONG (first case: qdmexa vs meta)
- Full input: Shows similar patterns of wrong outputs, likely incorrect

Solution 004:
- Sample input: WRONG (first case: meta vs meta)
- Full input: No obviously wrong outputs, follows expected patterns

Solution 006:
- Sample input: WRONG (first case: qdmexa vs meta)
- Full input: Some outputs seem inconsistent with constraints

Solution 003:
- Sample input: No output (empty strings)
- Full input: Many empty outputs, clearly incorrect

Solution 000:
- Sample input: WRONG (first case: m vs meta)
- Full input: Outputs are too short, likely incorrect

Solution 009:
- Sample input: WRONG (first case: mexa vs meta)
- Full input: Shows inconsistent patterns

Solution 011:
- Sample input: WRONG (first case: mexa vs meta)
- Full input: Shows inconsistent patterns

Solution 001:
- Sample input: WRONG (first case: a vs meta)
- Full input: Outputs are too short, likely incorrect

Solution 007:
- Sample input: No output (empty strings)
- Full input: Many empty strings, clearly incorrect

Solution 010:
- Sample input: WRONG (first case: dmexa vs meta)
- Full input: Shows inconsistent patterns

Comparing algorithms:
1. Solution 005 uses a character-by-character approach with proper backtracking and conflict resolution
2. Many solutions (002, 006, 009, 010, 011) use greedy approaches that don't properly handle conflicts
3. Some solutions (003, 007) fail to produce any output in many cases
4. Solutions 000, 001 produce outputs that are too short
5. Solution 008 produces outputs that are too complex

The best solution is <index>005</index> because:
1. It correctly handles the sample input (matches expected output exactly)
2. Its full input outputs are consistent with the problem constraints
3. It uses a methodical character-by-character approach to build strings while properly handling conflicts
4. The algorithm considers all robots' positions and movements while maintaining the lexicographical ordering requirement
5. It's the only solution that consistently produces correct outputs for both sample and full inputs
6. The implementation properly handles the constraint that no two robots can occupy the same cell at the same time
