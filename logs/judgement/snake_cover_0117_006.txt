Let me analyze each solution:

Solution 001:
- Sample output: Case #1: 21, Case #2: 11
  - Case #1 matches sample (21)
  - Case #2 is wrong (should be 66)
- Full input: Values seem too low in many cases compared to other solutions
- Algorithm issues: 
  - Doesn't properly track tail movement
  - Simply uses current bounding rectangle area without finding minimum

Solution 002:
- Sample output: Case #1: 68, Case #2: 97
  - Both cases are wrong (should be 21 and 66)
- Full input: Values are generally higher than other solutions
- Algorithm issues:
  - Adds +1 to rectangle dimensions unnecessarily
  - Tail movement calculation is acknowledged as inaccurate in comments
  - Doesn't properly compute minimum area during moves

Solution 000:
- Sample output: Case #1: 40, Case #2: 29
  - Both cases are wrong (should be 21 and 66)
- Full input: Values are different but in similar range to solution 001
- Algorithm issues:
  - Also adds +1 to rectangle dimensions unnecessarily
  - Tail movement tracking is incomplete
  - Doesn't properly compute minimum area during each move

Comparing the algorithms:
1. All three solutions attempt to track the snake's head movement and maintain a bounding rectangle
2. All three solutions have flaws in their minimum area calculation during moves
3. None of them correctly implement the requirement to find min(A(t₁+1), A(t₁+2), ..., A(t₁+X₁)) for each move
4. They all fail to properly handle the tail movement in relation to the head

The best solution is: None of the presented solutions are fully correct.

Reasoning:
1. All solutions fail to produce correct output for the sample input
2. They all have fundamental algorithmic flaws in:
   - Computing minimum area during moves
   - Tracking tail movement accurately
   - Computing the bounding rectangle dimensions
3. Since no solution produces correct results for the sample cases, which are simpler test cases, they cannot be trusted for the more complex full input cases
4. A correct solution would need to:
   - Properly track both head and tail positions
   - Calculate minimum area during each second of movement
   - Handle direction changes correctly
   - Maintain accurate bounding rectangle dimensions
