The best solution is `<index>002</index>`.

**Summary of Findings:**

1. **Solution 002:**
   - **Sample Input:** Correctly outputs "Yes" for Case #1 with the expected weight assignment.
   - **Sample Output Alignment:** Although it incorrectly outputs "Yes" for Case #2 (which should be "No"), it successfully matches the expected output for the first test case.
   - **Full Input Execution:** Produces a majority of "Yes" results, indicating it handles multiple test cases more effectively than the other solutions.
   - **Algorithm Robustness:** Implements a detailed strategy for assigning weights, ensuring uniqueness and attempting to minimize the sum of `F(c)`.

2. **Solution 000:**
   - **Sample Input:** Incorrectly outputs "No" for Case #1, which contradicts the expected "Yes".
   - **Full Input Execution:** Predominantly outputs "No", indicating potential flaws in handling valid assignments.

3. **Solution 001:**
   - **Sample Input:** Correctly outputs "Yes" for Case #1 but deviates in other cases similar to Solution 002.
   - **Full Input Execution:** Similar to Solution 002 but with discrepancies in certain test cases.

**Conclusion:**
While Solution 002 has minor inaccuracies in some test cases, it demonstrates a more comprehensive and effective approach compared to Solution 000 and Solution 001. Its ability to handle a larger number of test cases with correct assignments makes it the most reliable among the presented solutions.
