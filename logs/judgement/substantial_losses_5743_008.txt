Let me analyze each solution:

Solution 002:
- Correct output for sample input (matches exactly)
- Full input output looks reasonable with no obvious errors
- Algorithm uses (W-G) × (2L+1) formula with proper modulo handling

Solution 000:
- Correct output for sample input (matches exactly)
- Full input output looks reasonable with no obvious errors
- Algorithm uses same formula as 002 with similar implementation and modulo handling

Solution 001:
- Correct output for sample input (matches exactly)
- Full input output looks reasonable with no obvious errors
- Algorithm has special case for L=0 but otherwise uses same formula as others with proper modulo handling

Algorithm Comparison:
- All three solutions use essentially the same core algorithm: (W-G) × (2L+1) mod 998244353
- Solution 001 adds a special case for L=0 but this isn't necessary as the formula works correctly for L=0 as well
- All solutions properly handle the modulo arithmetic to avoid overflow
- No obviously wrong algorithms among the three

The best solution is <index>000</index> because:
1. It handles all cases correctly with a clean, streamlined implementation
2. It doesn't include unnecessary special cases (like 001's L=0 case)
3. It includes proper input handling using sys.stdin.readline() for better performance
4. It has clear variable names and good code organization
5. It properly implements the mathematical formula while handling modular arithmetic correctly

While all three solutions are technically correct, solution 000 has the most robust and efficient implementation with the cleanest code structure.
