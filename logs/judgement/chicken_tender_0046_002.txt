Let me analyze each solution:

Solution 001:
- Sample input: Correct output (Case #1: Yes, Case #2: No, Case #3: Yes)
- Full input: No obviously wrong outputs. The outputs seem reasonable and varied.
- Algorithm looks solid with proper geometric transformations and checks.

Solution 002:
- Sample input: Wrong output (All "No")
- Full input: Almost all outputs are "No" except for two cases, which seems suspicious
- Algorithm has issues in its geometric calculations or validation checks

Solution 000:
- Sample input: Wrong output (All "No")
- Full input: Almost all outputs are "No" except for one case, which seems suspicious
- Algorithm appears to have issues with its rotation and validation logic

Comparing the algorithms:
- Solution 001 has comprehensive geometric checks including rotation, translation, and proper boundary validation
- Solutions 002 and 000 appear to be too restrictive in their checks, causing most test cases to fail
- Solution 001 properly handles the edge cases and polygon transformations
- Solutions 002 and 000 seem to have issues with their geometric calculations or validation logic, leading to false negatives

The best solution is <index>001</index> because:
1. It correctly handles the sample cases, matching the expected output
2. It produces reasonable varied outputs for the full input (mix of Yes/No)
3. Its algorithm is mathematically sound, properly implementing:
   - Rotation of the polygon for each possible edge alignment
   - Translation to satisfy the x-axis constraint
   - Proper geometric checks for containment and overlap
   - Careful handling of floating-point precision issues
4. It has comprehensive validation of all required conditions from the problem statement
