Let me analyze each solution:

Solution 007:
- Correct output for sample input
- No obviously wrong output for full input
- Algorithm uses (W-G)*(2L+1) with proper modulo arithmetic

Solution 005:
- Correct output for sample input
- No obviously wrong output for full input
- Algorithm uses (W-G)*(2L+1) with proper modulo arithmetic

Solution 006:
- Correct output for sample input
- No obviously wrong output for full input
- Algorithm uses (W-G)*(2L+1) with proper modulo arithmetic

Solution 003:
- Correct output for sample input
- No obviously wrong output for full input
- Algorithm uses (W-G)*(2L+1) with proper modulo arithmetic

Solution 000:
- Correct output for sample input
- No obviously wrong output for full input
- Algorithm uses (W-G)*(2L+1) with proper modulo arithmetic

Solution 001:
- Correct output for sample input
- No obviously wrong output for full input
- Algorithm uses (W-G)*(2L+1) with proper modulo arithmetic

Solution 009:
- Correct output for sample input
- No obviously wrong output for full input
- Algorithm uses (W-G)*(2L+1) with proper modulo arithmetic

Solution 004:
- Correct output for sample input
- No obviously wrong output for full input
- Algorithm uses (W-G)*(2L+1) with proper modulo arithmetic

Comparing algorithms:
- All solutions implement essentially the same algorithm: (W-G)*(2L+1) mod 998244353
- They handle the L=0 case correctly by just using W-G
- All solutions properly handle modulo arithmetic to avoid overflow
- No obviously wrong algorithms detected

The best solution is <index>004</index> because:
1. It has the clearest and most efficient implementation using sys.stdin.read() for fast input
2. It properly handles both the L=0 and L>0 cases explicitly
3. It uses clean modular arithmetic to avoid overflow
4. The code is well-structured with separate readints() function and main()
5. It's one of the most concise yet readable implementations, making it easier to maintain and understand
6. It properly processes all inputs in a batch manner rather than one at a time, making it more efficient for large test cases
