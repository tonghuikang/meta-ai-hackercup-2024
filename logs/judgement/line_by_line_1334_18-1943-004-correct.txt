After carefully reviewing all presented solutions, here's a summary of the findings:

### **Solution Analysis:**

1. **Solution ID: 002**
   - **Approach:** Utilizes logarithmic transformations to solve for the increased probability \( P_{\text{new}} \).
   - **Implementation Issues:**
     - Outputs negative increases for certain test cases, which is logically incorrect since the increase in probability cannot be negative.
     - Does not handle edge cases where \( P = 0 \) appropriately, despite constraints ensuring \( P \geq 1 \).

2. **Solution ID: 004**
   - **Approach:** Similar to Solution 002, it uses logarithms to compute \( P_{\text{new}} \).
   - **Implementation Issues:**
     - Also produces negative increases in some cases.
     - Slight discrepancies in floating-point precision compared to other solutions.

3. **Solution ID: 001**
   - **Approach:** Mirrors the logic of Solutions 002 and 004 with logarithmic calculations.
   - **Implementation Issues:**
     - Negative increases are present in its output for specific test cases.
     - Does not adequately address floating-point inaccuracies for very small increases.

4. **Solution ID: 003**
   - **Approach:** Follows the same fundamental method as the previous solutions.
   - **Implementation Issues:**
     - Similar negative increase issues.
     - Attempts to correct minor floating-point inaccuracies but still falls short in some scenarios.

5. **Solution ID: 000**
   - **Approach:** Employs logarithmic transformations with added precision handling.
   - **Implementation Strengths:**
     - Ensures high floating-point precision by formatting the output to 15 decimal places.
     - Correctly handles edge cases, preventing negative increases by setting them to zero when they fall below a negligible threshold due to floating-point errors.
     - Outputs are consistent and adhere closely to expected results without introducing logically incorrect values.

### **Conclusion:**

Among all the presented solutions, **Solution ID: 000** stands out as the most robust and accurate. It not only implements the correct mathematical approach but also meticulously handles edge cases and floating-point precision issues, ensuring that the output remains logical and within the required accuracy bounds.
