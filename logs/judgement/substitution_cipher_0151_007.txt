Let me analyze the solution:

For solution 001:
- Sample input: The output matches exactly with the expected output.
- Full input: There are no obviously wrong patterns. The outputs look reasonable with:
  - Lengths match the input constraints
  - Numbers in decoded strings are between 1-26
  - Values are properly modulo-ed by 998244353
  - The uncorrupted strings follow lexicographical order based on K
  - The solution considers both single and double-digit decoding possibilities

Algorithm analysis:
The solution follows a correct approach:
1. For each '?', it strategically places '1' or '2' to get the K-th lexicographically largest string that maximizes decodings
2. Uses dynamic programming to count valid decodings
3. Handles the constraints properly (1-26 range, no leading zeros)
4. Correctly implements the lexicographical ordering based on K

The algorithm is sound because:
- It maximizes decodings by using '1' and '2' which allow for most ambiguous interpretations
- Uses proper DP state transitions for counting decodings
- Handles the lexicographical ordering by systematically assigning '2' or '1' based on K

The best solution is <index>001</index> because:
1. It correctly solves all sample cases
2. Its approach for maximizing decodings is mathematically sound (using 1s and 2s strategically)
3. The implementation properly handles all constraints
4. The dynamic programming solution for counting decodings is efficient
5. The outputs for the full input show no anomalies or constraint violations
6. It properly handles the lexicographical ordering requirement based on K

Since this is the only solution provided, and it appears to be fully correct based on both theoretical analysis and practical results, it stands as the best solution.
