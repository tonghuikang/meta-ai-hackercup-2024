It's time to serve some sushi! You're preparing an omakase sushi platter will contain $N$ pieces of nigiri and $M$ pieces of sashimi, to be eaten in a specific order. Each piece has a **distinct** tastiness value. The \(i\)th piece of nigiri has tastiness $A_i$, and the \(i\)th piece of sashimi has tastiness $B_i$. 

The final platter combines and rearranges these $n = N+M$ pieces in some permutation $P$ with the \(i\)th piece having tastiness $P_i$.

The customer will appreciate the platter more if consecutive pieces of sushi do not differ too much in tastiness. To evaluate this, you've defined the "unevenness score" of $P$ as:
\[S(P) = |P_1-P_2| + … + |P_i - P_{i+1}| + … + |P_{n-1}-P_n |\]

You'd like to know how many permutations $P$ of the combined sushi pieces exist such that $S(P) \le L$. As this number may be very large, output it modulo $1{,}000{,}000{,}007$.

# Constraints
$1 \le T \le 65$
$1 \le N \le 50$
$1 \le M \le 5$
$1 \le L \le 1{,}000{,}000{,}000$
$1 \le A_i \le 100$
$101 \le B_i \le 1{,}000{,}000{,}000$

Note the discrepancies between $N$ and $M$, and between $A_i$ and $B_i$. After all, sashimi is both more expensive and more delicious.

# Input Format
Input begins with an integer \(T\), the number of test cases. The first line of each case contains the three integers $N$, $M$, and $L$. The second line of each case contains the $N$ integers $A_{1..N}$. The third line of each test case contains the $M$ integers $B_{1..M}$.

# Output Format
For the \(i\)th test case, print "`Case #i:` " followed by a single integer, the number of permutations $P$ such that $S(P) \le L$, modulo $1{,}000{,}000{,}007$.

# Sample Explanation
In the first case, the pieces of sushi have tastiness values of \([1, 2, 3, 101, 102]\). The only two permutations have these values that have an unevenness of at most \(101\) are the order above, and the reverse: \([102, 101, 3, 2, 1]\), each of which have an unevenness of exactly \(101\).

In the second case, a permutation like \([7, 8, 11, 12, 101, 102, 1000, 10000]\) has an unevenness of \(1 + 3 + 1 + 89 + 1 + 898 + 9000 = 9{,}993\), which is less than \(L = 10{,}100\), while a permutation like \([10000, 7, 1000, 101, 102, 8, 11, 12]\) has an unevenness of \(9993 + 993 + 899 + 1 + 94 + 3 + 1 = 11{,}984\) which is greater than \(L\).
