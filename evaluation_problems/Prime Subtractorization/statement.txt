A prime number is an *$N$-subtractorization* if it can be expressed as the difference of two primes that are both at most $N$. For example, the complete set of *$5$-subtractorizations* is $\{2, 3\}$ because $5 - 3 = 2$ and $5 - 2 = 3$.

For a given $N$, how many *$N$-subtractorizations* are there?

# Constraints
\(1 \leq T \leq 100\)
\(1 \leq N \leq 10{,}000{,}000\)

# Input Format
Input begins with an integer \(T\), the number of test cases. Each case is a single line that contains the integer \(N\).

# Output Format
For the \(i\)th test case, print "`Case #i:` " followed by a single integer, the number of *$N$-subtractorizations*.

# Sample Explanation
The first case is explained above.

In the second case, the complete set of *$8$-subtractorizations* is $\{2, 3, 5\}$.
