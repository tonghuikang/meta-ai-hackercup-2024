You found a magic coin exchange machine which takes dollar bills and randomly dispenses coins among $N$ different denominations. As an avid coin collector with a stack of old dollar bills, you'd like to try to obtain at least one copy of each coin denomination.

If you insert $1$ dollar bill, you'll get a random coin (with $1/N$ probability of getting any specific denomination). However, you can spend more in each exchange to increase the chance of getting a new denomination you don't have. 

If you simultaneously insert $D$ dollar bills, you’ll get a $\min((D - 1) \cdot P, 100)$ percent chance of receiving a coin denomination you don’t yet have, and a $100 - \min((D - 1) \cdot P, 100)$ percent chance of receiving a random coin.

If you optimally choose how many dollar bills to insert in each exchange, how many dollar bills will it take, on average, to collect one copy of every coin?

Your answer will be accepted if it has a relative error of at most $10^{-6}$.

# Constraints
\(1 \leq T \leq 60\)
\(1 \leq N \leq 10^{15}\)
\(0 \leq P \leq 100\)

# Input Format
Input begins with an integer \(T\), the number of test cases. Each case is a single line with the integers $N$ and $P$.

# Output Format
For the \(i\)th test case, print "`Case #i:` " followed by the expected number of dollar bills you'll spend before getting at least one copy of each coin denomination, if you exchange optimally.

# Sample Explanation
In the first case, you can't spend additional bills for any better chances of a new coin, so you'll just spend $1$ bill each time. You always get a new coin for your first bill. The expected number of bills you'll spend to get your second coin is $1 \cdot \frac{2}{3} + 2 \cdot \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{2}{3} + 3 \cdot (\frac{1}{3}^2) \cdot \frac{2}{3}... = \frac{3}{2}$. For the third coin you'll spend $1 \cdot \frac{1}{3} + 2 \cdot \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{3} + 3 \cdot (\frac{2}{3}^2) \cdot \frac{1}{3} + ... = 3$. In total, that's $1 + \frac{3}{2} + 3 = 5.5$ bills on average.

In the second case, your best strategy is to repeatedly spend $1$ bill until you have $2$ coins, and then spend $2$ bills to guarantee your third coin. You'll spend $1 + \frac{3}{2} + 2 = 4.5$ bills on average.
