**Key Findings:**

1. **Problem Similarity:**
   - The problem resembles the classic bridge crossing puzzle where a group of people must cross a bridge with limited capacity and constraints on crossing times.

2. **Wheelbarrow Mechanism:**
   - The introduction of the wheelbarrow allows one traveler to carry another, effectively letting two travelers cross in the time taken by the faster traveler.
   - This changes the strategy compared to the standard problem, as pairing travelers can optimize crossing times differently.

3. **Sorting Travelers:**
   - Sorting the travelers by their crossing times in ascending order is beneficial. This allows for efficient pairing and decision-making when choosing which travelers to send or bring back.

4. **Greedy Strategy:**
   - Utilize a greedy approach inspired by the standard bridge crossing problem:
     - At each step, decide between two options:
       - **Option 1:** The fastest traveler carries the slowest remaining traveler, then returns.
       - **Option 2:** The two fastest travelers cross together, one returns, and then the two slowest cross.
     - Choose the option that minimizes the total crossing time.

5. **Handling Remaining Travelers:**
   - After iterating through the majority of travelers, handle the last one or two travelers separately to ensure all are accounted for within the time limit.

6. **Efficiency Considerations:**
   - With constraints up to \(N = 1{,}000\) and \(T = 95\), an \(O(N \log N)\) solution per test case (due to sorting) is efficient and feasible.

7. **Time Comparison:**
   - After calculating the minimal total crossing time using the above strategy, compare it with the allowed time \(K\) to determine if crossing within the time limit is possible.

**Python Code:**

```python
import sys

def can_cross_within_k(N, K, S):
    S.sort()
    total_time = 0
    left = N
    # If only one or two people
    if N == 1:
        total_time = S[0]
    elif N == 2:
        total_time = S[1]
    else:
        while left > 3:
            option1 = S[1] + S[0] + S[left-1] + S[1]
            option2 = S[left-1] + S[0] + S[left-2] + S[0]
            total_time += min(option1, option2)
            left -= 2
        if left == 3:
            total_time += S[0] + S[1] + S[2]
        elif left == 2:
            total_time += S[1]
        else: # left ==1
            total_time += S[0]
    return total_time <= K

def main():
    input = sys.stdin.read().split()
    idx = 0
    T = int(input[idx]); idx +=1
    for test_case in range(1, T+1):
        N, K = int(input[idx]), int(input[idx+1]); idx +=2
        S = []
        for _ in range(N):
            S.append(int(input[idx]))
            idx +=1
        result = "YES" if can_cross_within_k(N, K, S) else "NO"
        print(f"Case #{test_case}: {result}")
