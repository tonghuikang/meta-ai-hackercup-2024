**Key Findings:**

1. **Problem Similarity:** The problem is akin to the classic bridge-crossing puzzle but introduces a wheelbarrow that allows one traveler to carry another, enabling two people to cross with the time equal to the faster traveler.

2. **Optimal Strategy:** 
   - **Sorting:** Begin by sorting the travelers' crossing times in ascending order.
   - **Two Strategies per Step:**
     - **Strategy 1:** The fastest traveler (S₁) escorts the two slowest travelers one by one.
       - Time taken: `2 * S₁ + S_{N-1} + S_N`
     - **Strategy 2:** The two fastest travelers facilitate the crossing of the two slowest.
       - Time taken: `2 * S₂ + S₁ + S_N`
   - At each step, choose the strategy that results in the minimal additional time and reduce the problem size by two travelers.
   
3. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Single Traveler:** If there's only one traveler, they cross alone.
   - **Two Travelers:** Both can cross together with the time of the faster traveler.
   - **Time Constraints:** Ensure that the total calculated time does not exceed the given limit \( K \).

4. **Efficiency Considerations:**
   - Given the constraints \( N \leq 1000 \), an \( O(N) \) approach per test case is feasible.
   - Implementing the strategies iteratively after sorting ensures optimal performance.

**Python Code:**

```python
def solve_bridge_crossing():
    import sys

    T = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    for case in range(1, T+1):
        N, K = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
        S = [int(sys.stdin.readline()) for _ in range(N)]
        S.sort()
        total_time = 0
        i = N
        while i > 0:
            if i == 1:
                total_time += S[0]
                i -= 1
            elif i == 2:
                total_time += S[1]
                i -= 2
            elif i == 3:
                total_time += S[0] + S[1] + S[2]
                i -= 3
            else:
                # Two strategies
                option1 = 2 * S[0] + S[i-2] + S[i-1]
                option2 = S[1] + S[0] + S[i-1] + S[1]
                total_time += min(option1, option2)
                i -= 2
        if total_time <= K:
            result = "YES"
        else:
            result = "NO"
        print(f"Case #{case}: {result}")
