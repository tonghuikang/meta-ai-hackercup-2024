**Key Findings:**

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem resembles the classic bridge-crossing puzzle where a group must cross a bridge with constraints on crossing times and the need to return the flashlight.
   - An additional twist is the introduction of a wheelbarrow, allowing two travelers to cross with the crossing time equal to the carrier's time.

2. **Strategy:**
   - **Sorting:** Begin by sorting the travelers' crossing times in ascending order. This facilitates optimal pairing.
   - **Greedy Approach:** Utilize a greedy strategy similar to the classic problem, where at each step, decide between two strategies:
     1. **Strategy A:** Send the two fastest travelers first, have the fastest return, then send the two slowest travelers, and have the second fastest return.
     2. **Strategy B:** Send the fastest traveler with the slowest traveler, have the fastest return, then send the fastest with the next slowest traveler, and have the fastest return again.
   - **Comparison:** At each step, compare the total time of both strategies and choose the one with the lesser time.
   - **Termination:** Repeat the process until all travelers have crossed or until the total time exceeds \( K \).

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Single Traveler:** If there's only one traveler, simply check if their crossing time is within \( K \).
   - **All Travelers:** Ensure that the combined crossing times of all possible sequences do not exceed \( K \).

4. **Efficiency:**
   - Given the constraints (\( N \leq 1000 \) and \( T \leq 95 \)), the approach must be efficient, ideally \( O(N \log N) \) per test case due to sorting.

5. **Implementation Considerations:**
   - Carefully handle the crossing times based on who is carrying the wheelbarrow.
   - Accumulate the total time and ensure it does not exceed \( K \).
   - Use zero-based indexing for travelers after sorting.

**Python Code:**

```python
import sys

def can_cross(N, K, S):
    S.sort()
    total_time = 0
    left = N
    i = N - 1

    while left > 0:
        if left == 1:
            total_time += S[0]
            left -= 1
        elif left == 2:
            total_time += S[0]
            left -= 2
        elif left == 3:
            total_time += S[0] + S[1] + S[2]
            left -= 3
        else:
            option1 = S[1] + S[0] + S[i] + S[1]
            option2 = S[i] + S[0] + S[i-1] + S[0]
            total_time += min(option1, option2)
            left -= 2
            i -= 2

    return total_time <= K

def main():
    input = sys.stdin.read().split()
    T = int(input[0])
    ptr = 1
    for test_case in range(1, T+1):
        N, K = int(input[ptr]), int(input[ptr+1])
        ptr += 2
        S = []
        for _ in range(N):
            S.append(int(input[ptr]))
            ptr +=1
        result = "YES" if can_cross(N, K, S) else "NO"
        print(f"Case #{test_case}: {result}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**Explanation of the Code:**

1. **Function `can_cross`:**
   - **Parameters:** 
     - `N`: Number of travelers.
     - `K`: Maximum allowed time.
     - `S`: List of individual crossing times.
   - **Process:**
     - Sort the list `S` in ascending order.
     - Initialize `total_time` to track the cumulative crossing time.
     - Use a `while` loop to process the travelers from the slowest to the fastest.
     - For each scenario (1, 2, 3, or more travelers left), calculate the time using two possible strategies and choose the minimum.
     - Subtract the number of travelers who have crossed from `left` and adjust the index `i` accordingly.
   - **Return:** `True` if `total_time` is within `K`, else `False`.

2. **Function `main`:**
   - **Process:**
     - Read all input at once and split it into tokens.
     - Iterate through each test case, extract `N`, `K`, and the list `S`.
     - Call `can_cross` to determine if crossing within `K` seconds is possible.
     - Print the result in the required format.

3. **Execution:**
   - The script reads from standard input and writes to standard output.
   - It handles multiple test cases efficiently within the given constraints.
