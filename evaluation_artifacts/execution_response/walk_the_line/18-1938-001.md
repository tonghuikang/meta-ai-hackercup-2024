To solve this problem efficiently, we need to find the minimum total time required for all travelers to cross the bridge while accounting for the constraints given (wheelbarrow usage, flashlight, crossing times, etc.). Here's a summary of the key findings and strategy:

**Key Findings:**

1. **Sorting Helps:** By sorting the travelers based on their crossing times (from fastest to slowest), we can plan the crossings more strategically.

2. **Optimal Crossings:**
   - **Option 1 (Two Fastest Shuttle):**
     - Send the two fastest travelers across.
     - The fastest traveler returns with the flashlight.
     - The two slowest travelers cross together (with the fastest pushing one in the wheelbarrow).
     - The second fastest returns with the flashlight.
     - Total time for this option: `S[1] + S[0] + S[N-1] + S[1]` where `S[i]` is the crossing time for the i-th traveler.
   - **Option 2 (Fastest Shuttles Slowest Individually):**
     - The fastest and the slowest cross.
     - The fastest returns.
     - Repeat this for the next slowest.
     - Total time for this option: `2 * S[0] + S[N-2] + S[N-1]`.

3. **Choosing the Minimum Time:** For each step, we choose the option that results in the minimum additional time and subtract two travelers from the group since two have crossed to the other side.

4. **Handling Edge Cases:** For the remaining 1 to 3 travelers, we handle their crossings separately to ensure we cover all possibilities.

5. **Comparing with Allowed Time (K):** After calculating the minimal total time required, we compare it with the given time limit `K` to determine if it's possible for all travelers to cross in time.

6. **Implementation Considerations:** Be careful with input reading, especially with multiple numbers per line, and ensure using appropriate data types to handle large numbers (up to \(1{,}000{,}000{,}000\)).

Here is the Python code implementing the above strategy:

```python
T = int(input())
for test_case in range(1, T+1):
    import sys
    input_data = []
    while len(input_data) < 2:
        input_data += sys.stdin.readline().split()
    N, K = map(int, input_data[:2])
    input_data = input_data[2:]
    S = []
    while len(S) < N:
        if len(input_data) == 0:
            input_data += sys.stdin.readline().split()
        S.append(int(input_data.pop(0)))
    S.sort()
    total_time = 0
    n = N
    while n > 3:
        Option1_time = S[0] + 2*S[1] + S[n-1]
        Option2_time = 2*S[0] + S[n-2] + S[n-1]
        total_time += min(Option1_time, Option2_time)
        n -= 2  # Two travelers have crossed to the other side
    if n == 1:
        total_time += S[0]
    elif n == 2:
        total_time += S[1]
    elif n == 3:
        total_time += min(
            S[0] + S[1] + S[2],
            2*S[1] + S[0],
            2*S[0] + S[1]
        )
    if total_time <= K:
        print(f"Case #{test_case}: YES")
    else:
        print(f"Case #{test_case}: NO")
```
