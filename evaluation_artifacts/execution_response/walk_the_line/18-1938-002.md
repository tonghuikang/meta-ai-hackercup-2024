**Key Findings:**

1. **Problem Similarity:** The problem resembles the classic bridge crossing puzzle but with a different cost function. Instead of the crossing time being the maximum of the two travelers' times, it is based on the carrier's (the one with the lower \( S_i \)) time.

2. **Sorting:** To optimize the crossing strategy, sort the travelers' times in ascending order. This allows the fastest travelers to assist in ferrying the slower ones, minimizing the total time.

3. **Greedy Strategy:** Implement a greedy approach where, at each step, you decide between two strategies:
    - **Option 1:** 
        - The two fastest travelers cross together.
        - The fastest returns.
        - The two slowest travelers cross together.
        - The second fastest returns.
    - **Option 2:**
        - The fastest and the slowest travelers cross together.
        - The fastest returns.
        - The fastest and the second slowest cross together.
        - The fastest returns.

4. **Total Time Calculation:** Continuously apply the optimal option until all travelers have crossed. For the final few travelers, handle them with special cases to ensure the minimal total time.

5. **Verification:** After calculating the minimal total time, compare it with \( K \) to determine if the crossing is possible within the allotted time.

**Python Code:**

```python
def solve_bridge_crossing():
    import sys
    import math

    T = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    for tc in range(1, T+1):
        N,K = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
        S = []
        for _ in range(N):
            S.append(int(sys.stdin.readline()))
        S.sort()
        total_time =0
        p = N-1
        while p >=3:
            # Option1: S1 and S2 cross, S1 returns, SN-1 and SN cross, S2 returns
            option1 = 2*S[1] + S[0] + S[p]
            # Option2: S1 and SN cross, S1 returns, S1 and SN-1 cross, S1 returns
            option2 = 2*S[0] + S[p-1] + S[p]
            total_time += min(option1, option2)
            p -=2
        if p ==2:
            total_time += S[0] + S[1] + S[2]
        elif p ==1:
            total_time += S[1]
        elif p ==0:
            total_time += S[0]
        if total_time <= K:
            print(f"Case #{tc}: YES")
        else:
            print(f"Case #{tc}: NO")
