**Key Findings:**

1. **Probability Calculations:**
   - **Original Scenario:** The probability of successfully typing \( N \) lines correctly is \( \left(\frac{P}{100}\right)^N \).
   - **Reduced Lines Scenario:** The probability of successfully typing \( N-1 \) lines correctly is \( \left(\frac{P}{100}\right)^{N-1} \).
   - **Enhanced Accuracy Scenario:** To match the success probability of the reduced lines scenario while typing \( N \) lines, we need to find a new probability \( P_{\text{new}} \) such that:
     \[
     \left(\frac{P_{\text{new}}}{100}\right)^N = \left(\frac{P}{100}\right)^{N-1}
     \]
     Solving for \( P_{\text{new}} \):
     \[
     P_{\text{new}} = 100 \times \left(\frac{P}{100}\right)^{\frac{N-1}{N}}
     \]
   - **Increase Required:** The required increase in \( P \) is \( P_{\text{new}} - P \).

2. **Implementation Considerations:**
   - **Precision:** To ensure the answer meets the required precision (within an absolute or relative error of \( 10^{-6} \)), it's essential to use floating-point arithmetic with sufficient precision.
   - **Edge Cases:** Given the constraints \( 1 \leq P \leq 99 \) and \( 2 \leq N \leq 1000 \), careful handling of small increases is necessary to avoid floating-point inaccuracies.

3. **Output Formatting:**
   - Each test case should be prefixed with "`Case #i:`", where `i` is the test case number starting from 1.
   - The increase should be printed with high precision, adhering to the problem's acceptance criteria.

Below is the Python implementation based on the above findings:

```python
import math

def main():
    import sys
    T = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    for case in range(1, T + 1):
        line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()
        if not line:
            # In case of blank lines
            line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()
        N_str, P_str = line.split()
        N = int(N_str)
        P = int(P_str)
        
        P_decimal = P / 100.0
        exponent = (N - 1) / N
        P_new_decimal = math.pow(P_decimal, exponent)
        P_new = P_new_decimal * 100.0
        increase = P_new - P
        # To handle very small negative values due to floating point inaccuracies, ensure non-negative
        if increase < 0 and abs(increase) < 1e-12:
            increase = 0.0
        print(f"Case #{case}: {increase}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
