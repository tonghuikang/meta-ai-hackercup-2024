**Key Findings:**

To solve the problem, we need to determine how much the probability \( P \) must increase to achieve the same success rate when typing \( N \) lines as typing \( N-1 \) lines with the original probability \( P \).

1. **Understanding Success Probabilities:**
   - The probability of successfully typing \( N \) lines correctly is \( (P/100)^N \).
   - The probability of successfully typing \( N-1 \) lines correctly is \( (P/100)^{N-1} \).

2. **Equating Success Probabilities:**
   - We want the probability of typing \( N \) lines with an increased probability \( Q \) to equal the probability of typing \( N-1 \) lines with the original probability \( P \):
     \[
     \left(\frac{Q}{100}\right)^N = \left(\frac{P}{100}\right)^{N-1}
     \]

3. **Solving for \( Q \):**
   - Taking the \( N \)-th root of both sides:
     \[
     \frac{Q}{100} = \left(\frac{P}{100}\right)^{\frac{N-1}{N}}
     \]
   - Therefore:
     \[
     Q = \left(\frac{P}{100}\right)^{\frac{N-1}{N}} \times 100
     \]

4. **Determining the Increase in \( P \):**
   - The required increase in \( P \) is \( Q - P \).

5. **Implementation Considerations:**
   - Use floating-point arithmetic to handle fractional probabilities.
   - Ensure precision by using sufficient decimal places to meet the error tolerance.
   - Handle multiple test cases efficiently.

**Python Code:**

```python
import math
import sys

def main():
    import sys

    T = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    for case in range(1, T + 1):
        line = sys.stdin.readline()
        while line.strip() == '':
            line = sys.stdin.readline()
        N_str, P_str = line.strip().split()
        N = int(N_str)
        P = float(P_str)

        if P == 0:
            # If P is 0, no increase can help
            delta = 0.0
        else:
            # Calculate Q
            # Q = (P / 100) ** ((N-1)/N) * 100
            # To prevent math domain error when P=0, already handled
            Q = (P / 100) ** ((N - 1) / N) * 100
            delta = Q - P

        print(f"Case #{case}: {delta}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
