**Key Findings:**

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much to increase the typing accuracy \( P \) so that typing \( N \) lines with the improved accuracy has the same probability of success as typing \( N-1 \) lines with the original accuracy.

1. **Probability Calculations**:
   - The probability of successfully typing \( N \) lines with accuracy \( P \%\) is \( \left(\frac{P}{100}\right)^N \).
   - The probability of successfully typing \( N-1 \) lines with the same accuracy is \( \left(\frac{P}{100}\right)^{N-1} \).

2. **Equating Probabilities**:
   - To find the new accuracy \( P_{\text{new}} \) such that \( \left(\frac{P_{\text{new}}}{100}\right)^N = \left(\frac{P}{100}\right)^{N-1} \), we solve for \( P_{\text{new}} \).

3. **Solving for \( P_{\text{new}} \)**:
   - Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:
     \[
     N \cdot \ln\left(\frac{P_{\text{new}}}{100}\right) = (N-1) \cdot \ln\left(\frac{P}{100}\right)
     \]
   - Solving for \( P_{\text{new}} \):
     \[
     P_{\text{new}} = 100 \times \left(\frac{P}{100}\right)^{\frac{N-1}{N}}
     \]
   - The required increase in \( P \) is \( P_{\text{new}} - P \).

4. **Implementation Considerations**:
   - Use precise floating-point arithmetic to maintain the required accuracy.
   - Handle multiple test cases efficiently.

Below is the Python code implementing this solution:

```python
import math
import sys

def main():
    T_and_cases = sys.stdin.read().split()
    T = int(T_and_cases[0])
    index = 1
    for case in range(1, T+1):
        N = int(T_and_cases[index])
        P = int(T_and_cases[index+1])
        index +=2
        if P ==0:
            # If P is 0, even increasing it won't help since 0^x =0, but based on constraints P >=1
            increase = 0.0
        else:
            original_prob = (P / 100.0) ** (N -1)
            # We need new_P such that (new_P /100)^N = original_prob
            # So new_P = 100 * (original_prob)^(1/N)
            new_P = 100.0 * (original_prob) ** (1.0 / N)
            increase = new_P - P
        print(f"Case #{case}: {increase:.15f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
