**Key Findings:**

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - You have two strategies:
     1. **Original Strategy:** Type out \(N\) lines with each line having a \(P\%\) chance of being correct. The probability of success is \((P/100)^N\).
     2. **Alternative Strategy:** Either:
        - Type out \(N-1\) lines with the same \(P\%\) accuracy, giving a success probability of \((P/100)^{N-1}\), or
        - Improve the accuracy to \(P'\%\) such that typing \(N\) lines yields the same success probability as typing \(N-1\) lines with the original \(P\%\).

2. **Equating Probabilities:**
   - To find the required increased accuracy \(P'\), set the probabilities equal:
     \[
     \left(\frac{P'}{100}\right)^N = \left(\frac{P}{100}\right)^{N-1}
     \]
   
3. **Solving for \(P'\):**
   - Taking the \(N\)th root of both sides:
     \[
     \frac{P'}{100} = \left(\frac{P}{100}\right)^{\frac{N-1}{N}}
     \]
   - Therefore:
     \[
     P' = 100 \times \left(\frac{P}{100}\right)^{\frac{N-1}{N}}
     \]
   
4. **Calculating the Increase:**
   - The required increase in accuracy is:
     \[
     \Delta P = P' - P
     \]
   
5. **Implementation Considerations:**
   - Use logarithms to accurately compute fractional exponents, especially for large \(N\) where direct computation might lead to underflow.
   - Ensure floating-point precision to meet the output accuracy requirements.

Below is the Python implementation based on these findings:

```python
import math
import sys

def calculate_increase(N, P):
    if P == 0:
        return 0.0  # If P is 0, no chance of success, but P >=1 per constraints
    # Calculate log((P/100)^(N-1)/N)
    # log(P_new/100) = (N-1)/N * log(P/100)
    log_P_over_100 = math.log(P / 100)
    exponent = (N -1)/N
    log_Pnew_over_100 = exponent * log_P_over_100
    P_new_over_100 = math.exp(log_Pnew_over_100)
    P_new = P_new_over_100 * 100
    increase = P_new - P
    return increase

def main():
    T = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    for case in range(1, T+1):
        line = ''
        while line.strip() == '':
            line = sys.stdin.readline()
        N_str, P_str = line.strip().split()
        N = int(N_str)
        P = float(P_str)
        increase = calculate_increase(N, P)
        # Ensure floating point precision with 15 decimal places
        print(f"Case #{case}: {increase:.15f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
