To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum constant speed that allows Sonic to deliver sandwiches to all stations within their respective delivery windows, or determine that no such speed exists.

**Key Findings:**

1. **Delivery Time Constraints:** 

   - Sonic arrives at station `i` at time `t_i = i / v`, where `v` is his constant speed.
   - The delivery window for station `i` is `[A_i, B_i]`, so we must have `A_i ≤ t_i ≤ B_i`.

2. **Deriving Speed Intervals for Each Station:**

   - From `A_i ≤ i / v ≤ B_i`, we rearrange to get `i / B_i ≤ v ≤ i / A_i`.
   - This gives us a speed interval `[v_min_i, v_max_i]` for each station, where:
     - `v_min_i = i / B_i`
     - `v_max_i = i / A_i` if `A_i > 0`; otherwise, `v_max_i = ∞` (since division by zero is undefined).

3. **Finding the Overall Acceptable Speed Interval:**

   - The overall acceptable speeds are in the intersection of all station intervals.
   - Compute:
     - `v_min_overall = max(v_min_i over all stations)`
     - `v_max_overall = min(v_max_i over all stations)`
   - If `v_min_overall ≤ v_max_overall`, there is at least one acceptable speed.
   - The minimal acceptable speed is `v_min_overall`.

4. **Handling Edge Cases:**

   - When `A_i = 0`, `v_max_i` is considered infinite, meaning there's no upper limit on the speed from this station's constraint.
   - Ensure divisions are handled carefully to avoid division by zero and floating-point inaccuracies.

5. **Floating Point Precision:**

   - Use sufficient precision to handle floating-point comparisons and outputs.
   - Include a small epsilon when comparing floating-point numbers to account for rounding errors.

6. **Algorithm Efficiency:**

   - Since the total number of stations across all test cases can be up to \(5 \times 10^6\), the algorithm must run in O(N) time per test case.

Below is the Python code implementing the above approach:

```python
import sys

T = int(sys.stdin.readline())

INF = float('inf')

for case_num in range(1, T+1):
    N = int(sys.stdin.readline())

    v_min_overall = 0.0
    v_max_overall = INF

    for i in range(1, N+1):
        A_i_str, B_i_str = sys.stdin.readline().split()
        A_i = int(A_i_str)
        B_i = int(B_i_str)

        v_min_i = i / B_i

        if A_i > 0:
            v_max_i = i / A_i
        else:
            v_max_i = INF

        v_min_overall = max(v_min_overall, v_min_i)
        v_max_overall = min(v_max_overall, v_max_i)

    if v_min_overall <= v_max_overall + 1e-9:
        ans = v_min_overall
        print(f"Case #{case_num}: {ans}")
    else:
        print(f"Case #{case_num}: -1")
```
