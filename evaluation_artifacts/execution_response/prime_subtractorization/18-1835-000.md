**Key Findings:**

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to identify prime numbers \( p \) (termed *\( N \)-subtractorizations*) that can be expressed as the difference between two primes \( q \) and \( r \), such that both \( q \) and \( r \) are \( \leq N \).
   - For each test case, count the number of such primes \( p \).

2. **Constraints Analysis:**
   - With \( N \) up to \( 10^7 \) and up to 100 test cases, efficiency is crucial.
   - A brute-force approach of checking all possible prime pairs would be computationally infeasible.

3. **Efficient Approach Using Sieve of Eratosthenes and Numpy:**
   - **Prime Sieve:** Utilize the Sieve of Eratosthenes to generate a boolean array indicating prime numbers up to the maximum \( N \) across all test cases.
   - **Subtractor Identification:** For each prime \( r \), shift the sieve by \( r \) positions and perform a logical AND with the original sieve. This operation identifies all primes \( p \) such that \( p + r \) is also prime.
   - **Cumulative Counting:** Use Numpy's cumulative sum to precompute the number of valid subtractorizations up to each \( N \). This allows answering each test case in constant time.
   - **Optimization:** Leveraging Numpy's vectorized operations ensures that the solution runs efficiently even for large \( N \).

4. **Implementation Steps:**
   - **Preprocessing:**
     - Generate a sieve of primes up to the maximum \( N \) using Numpy for speed.
     - Identify all primes upfront to iterate over them efficiently.
   - **Marking Subtractorizations:**
     - For each prime \( r \), mark primes \( p \) such that \( p + r \) is also prime.
   - **Query Handling:**
     - Precompute cumulative counts of valid \( p \) up to each \( N \).
     - Respond to each test case using the precomputed counts.

5. **Final Considerations:**
   - Utilizing Numpy's efficient memory and computational capabilities ensures that even with the large upper bound of \( N \), the solution remains performant.
   - The approach avoids redundant computations by precomputing results that can be reused across multiple test cases.

        if r > N_max:
            break
        p_upper = N_max + 1 - r
        if p_upper <= 0:
            continue
        # Logical AND between p and p + r
        subtractor[:p_upper] |= (sieve[:p_upper] & sieve[r:p_upper + r])
    
    counts = np.cumsum(subtractor).astype(int)
