**Key Findings:**

1. **Understanding N-Subtractorization:**
   - An *N-subtractorization* is a prime number \( p \leq N \) that can be expressed as the difference of two primes \( q \) and \( r \) where both \( q \) and \( r \) are also \( \leq N \).
   - This can be represented as \( p = q - r \).

2. **Simplifying the Problem:**
   - For \( p = q - r \) to hold with \( p \) being prime:
     - If \( p = 2 \), then \( q = 2 + r \). We need \( q \) to be prime and \( q \leq N \). Thus, \( p = 2 \) is valid if \( N \geq 5 \) because \( q = 5 \) is the smallest prime greater than \( 2 \) that satisfies the condition.
     - For \( p \geq 3 \) (which are odd), to maintain \( p \) as prime, \( r \) must be \( 2 \) (the only even prime). Hence, \( p \) is valid if \( p + 2 \) is also prime and \( p + 2 \leq N \).

3. **Efficient Computation Using Sieve of Eratosthenes:**
   - Precompute all prime numbers up to the maximum \( N \) across all test cases using the Sieve of Eratosthenes.
   - Identify twin primes (pairs of primes that differ by 2), as these directly contribute to potential \( N \)-subtractorizations.
   - Utilize prefix sums to efficiently answer each test case by:
     - Adding 1 to the count if \( N \geq 5 \) (to account for \( p = 2 \)).
     - Adding the number of twin primes \( \leq N \).

4. **Handling Multiple Test Cases Efficiently:**
   - Since the maximum \( N \) can be up to \( 10^7 \) and there can be up to \( 100 \) test cases, it's optimal to compute the sieve and prefix sums once and use them to answer all queries.

def main():
    import sys
    import sys
    import sys

    import sys
    def input():
        return sys.stdin.read()

    data = sys.stdin.read().split()
    T = int(data[0])
    Ns = list(map(int, data[1:T+1]))
    max_N = max(Ns) if Ns else 0

    sieve = [True] * (max_N + 1)
    sieve[0] = sieve[1] = False
    for p in range(2, int(max_N**0.5) +1):
        if sieve[p]:
            for multiple in range(p*p, max_N +1, p):
                sieve[multiple] = False

    # Build twin prime prefix count
    twin_count_prefix = [0]*(max_N +1)
    count =0
    for i in range(2, max_N +1):
        twin_count_prefix[i] = twin_count_prefix[i-1]
        if i >=3 and sieve[i] and sieve[i -2]:
            twin_count_prefix[i] +=1

    # Precompute if p=2 is included
    # p=2 is included if N >=5 and sieve[5] is True
    # But sieve[5] is already checked in twin_count_prefix
    # So simply p=2 is included if N >=5
    for idx, N in enumerate(Ns,1):
        total = twin_count_prefix[N]
        if N >=5:
            total +=1
        print(f"Case #{idx}: {total}")
