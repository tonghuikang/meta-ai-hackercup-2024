To solve the problem of finding the number of *$N$-subtractorizations*, we need to efficiently identify primes \( p \) that can be expressed as the difference of two primes \( p = p_1 - p_2 \), where both \( p_1 \) and \( p_2 \) are primes less than or equal to \( N \), and \( p \) itself is prime.

**Key Findings:**

1. **Constraints on \( p \):** Since \( p = p_1 - p_2 > 0 \) and both \( p_1 \) and \( p_2 \) are primes less than or equal to \( N \), \( p \) must be less than or equal to \( N - 2 \) (since the smallest prime is 2).

2. **Efficient Calculation:** Instead of checking all possible pairs \( (p_1, p_2) \), which would be computationally intensive (\( O(P^2) \) operations), we can utilize the fact that \( p_1 = p + p_2 \). By fixing small primes for \( p_2 \), specifically \( p_2 \in \{2, 3, 5, 7\} \), we limit the number of computations per \( p \) to a small constant.

3. **Algorithm Steps:**
   - Generate all primes up to \( N \) using the Sieve of Eratosthenes.
   - For each prime \( p \) less than or equal to \( N - 2 \):
     - For each \( p_2 \) in \( \{2, 3, 5, 7\} \):
       - Calculate \( p_1 = p + p_2 \).
       - If \( p_1 \) is a prime less than or equal to \( N \), then \( p \) is an \( N \)-subtractorizations.

4. **Avoiding Duplicates:** Since each prime \( p \) is considered once and we break out of the loop after finding a valid \( p_2 \), we avoid counting duplicates.

5. **Handling Multiple Test Cases:** Precompute the list of primes and the sieve up to the maximum possible \( N \) to handle multiple test cases efficiently.

**Python Code:**

```python
import sys
import threading

def main():
    import bisect
    T = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    Ns = [int(sys.stdin.readline()) for _ in range(T)]
    N_MAX = max(Ns) + 10  # Incremented to ensure we cover up to N

    # Sieve of Eratosthenes
    is_prime = [True] * (N_MAX)
    is_prime[0], is_prime[1] = False, False
    for i in range(2, int(N_MAX**0.5) + 1):
        if is_prime[i]:
            for j in range(i*i, N_MAX, i):
                is_prime[j] = False
    # Generate list of primes
    primes_list = [p for p in range(2, N_MAX) if is_prime[p]]

    # Precompute primes set for quick lookup
    # is_prime list is already there

    for idx, N in enumerate(Ns, 1):
        ans = 0
        small_primes = [2, 3, 5, 7]
        index_limit = bisect.bisect_right(primes_list, N - 2)
        for p in primes_list[:index_limit]:
            for p2 in small_primes:
                p1 = p + p2
                if p1 > N:
                    break
                if is_prime[p1]:
                    ans += 1
                    break  # Stop checking other small_primes for this p
        print(f"Case #{idx}: {ans}")

threading.Thread(target=main).start()
```
