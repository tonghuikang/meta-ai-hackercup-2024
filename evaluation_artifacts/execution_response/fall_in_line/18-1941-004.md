**Key Findings:**

1. **Problem Interpretation**: We need to determine the minimum number of ants that need to move so that all ants lie on a single straight line. This is equivalent to finding the maximum number of colinear points and subtracting that number from the total number of ants.

2. **Constraints Analysis**:
   - The number of points \(N\) can be as large as \(1,000,000\), and there can be up to 75 test cases.
   - An exact solution with a time complexity of \(O(N^2)\) is impractical due to the large size of \(N\).

3. **Approach**:
   - **Random Sampling**: To handle large \(N\), we can use random sampling to approximate the maximum number of colinear points.
   - **Slope Calculation**: For a subset of randomly chosen points, compute the slope with every other point and identify the slope that appears most frequently, indicating the line with the most colinear points.
   - **Efficiency**: Since Python isn't the fastest language for this kind of computation, we optimize by limiting the number of random samples and using integer arithmetic to avoid floating-point precision issues.

4. **Implementation Considerations**:
   - **Line Representation**: To uniquely represent a line, we use the reduced form of the slope as a tuple \((\Delta Y, \Delta X)\) after dividing by their greatest common divisor (GCD). This avoids floating-point inaccuracies.
   - **Edge Cases**: Handle vertical lines where \(\Delta X = 0\) separately to avoid division by zero.
   - **Random Seed**: Set a random seed to ensure reproducibility and better randomness.

5. **Approximation Guarantee**: The problem allows answers between \(M\) and \(2*M\), where \(M\) is the minimal number of ants to move. Our approach aims to find an approximation within this range by sampling sufficiently many points to likely capture the line with the maximum number of colinear points.
