To solve this problem efficiently, especially given the large constraints on \( N \), we need to make strategic approximations:

1. **Observation**: The minimal number of ants that need to move is \( M = N - (\text{maximum number of colinear ants}) \).

2. **Challenge**: Computing the exact maximum number of colinear points among \( N \) points can be computationally intensive (O(\( N^2 \))), which is not feasible for large \( N \).

3. **Approximation**: Since any answer between \( M \) and \( 2 \times M \) (inclusive) is acceptable, we can approximate \( M \) by:
   - **For small \( N \) (\( N \leq 5000 \))**: Compute the exact maximum number of colinear points.
   - **For large \( N \) (\( N > 5000 \))**: Randomly sample a subset of points and compute the maximum number of colinear points among those samples.

4. **Slope Calculation**:
   - Represent slopes as reduced fractions (dy, dx) to handle floating-point precision issues and to correctly identify identical slopes.
   - Handle vertical lines separately by using a special representation for infinite slopes.

5. **Avoid Underestimation**: Ensure that we do not output a value less than the true minimal \( M \), as that would fall outside the acceptable answer range. Overestimating \( M \) is acceptable within the problem's constraints.

6. **Random Sampling**: By selecting random points and calculating slopes to all other points, we can get a good estimate of the maximum number of colinear ants without processing all pairs.
