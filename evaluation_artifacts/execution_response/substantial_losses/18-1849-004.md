To solve this problem, we analyze the behavior of the weight changes under the given constraints:

1. **When \( L = 0 \):**
   - **Constraint Interpretation:** You are not allowed to gain any weight. Therefore, each day you either lose 1 unit or stay the same in a deterministic manner.
   - **Expected Days Calculation:** Since you must lose weight deterministically, the expected number of days to reach \( G \) from \( W \) is simply \( W - G \).

2. **When \( L > 0 \):**
   - **Constraint Interpretation:** You can gain weight, but with a strict upper limit based on the minimum weight you've ever been. Specifically, your weight cannot exceed \( \text{min\_weight} + L \).
   - **Expected Days Calculation:** In this scenario, each unit of weight loss is balanced by the possibility of gaining weight within the allowed range. The expected number of days can be derived using the formula \( E = (W - G) \times (2L + 1) \).
   
3. **Modulo Operation:**
   - Since the expected number of days can be very large, we compute the result modulo \( 998{,}244{,}353 \) as required.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - Ensure to handle cases where \( L = 0 \) separately since the behavior differs significantly from when \( L > 0 \).

Based on these findings, the solution can be implemented efficiently even for large inputs.

```python
MOD = 998244353

def solve():
    import sys
    T,*rest = map(int, sys.stdin.read().split())
    for i in range(1,T+1):
        W, G, L = rest[3*(i-1):3*i]
        if L ==0:
            E = (W - G) % MOD
        else:
            diff = W - G
            factor = (2 * L +1) % MOD
            E = (diff % MOD) * factor % MOD
        print(f"Case #{i}: {E}")
```
