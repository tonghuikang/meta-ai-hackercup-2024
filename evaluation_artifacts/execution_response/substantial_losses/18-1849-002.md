**Key Findings:**

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - **Random Walk Dynamics:** Each day, weight can either increase or decrease by 1 unit with equal probability.
   - **Constraint Implementation:** If the weight has ever been `w`, future weight increases are restricted to not exceed `w + L`. If an increase would violate this, a decrease is enforced instead.
   - **Expected Days Calculation:** The goal is to determine the expected number of days to reach the target weight `G` from the current weight `W` under the given constraints.

2. **Special Cases:**
   - **When `L = 0`:** No weight gain is allowed. Thus, the weight must decrease by 1 unit each day deterministically. The expected number of days is simply `W - G`.
   - **When `L > 0`:** The problem can be modeled as a symmetric random walk between `G` and `W + L` with an absorbing boundary at `G` and a reflecting boundary at `W + L`.
     - **Expected Time Formula:** For this symmetric walk, the expected number of days to reach `G` from `W` is given by:
       \[
       \text{Expected Days} = (W - G) \times (W + L - G + 1)
       \]
   
3. **Handling Large Numbers:**
   - Given the constraints where `W`, `G`, and `L` can be up to \(10^{18}\), it's crucial to handle large integer computations efficiently.
   - **Modulo Operation:** Since the final answer requires the result modulo \(998244353\), and the expected days formula yields an integer, we can compute the result directly using modular arithmetic.

4. **Implementation Strategy:**
   - **Input Parsing:** For each test case, parse `W`, `G`, and `L`.
   - **Compute Expected Days:** Use the aforementioned formula based on whether `L` is zero or positive.
   - **Modulo Operation:** Compute the result modulo \(998244353\) to ensure it fits within the required range.
   - **Output Formatting:** Present the result in the specified format for each test case.

**Python Code:**

```python
import sys

def main():
    MOD = 998244353
    T = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    for tc in range(1, T+1):
        W_str, G_str, L_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()
        W = int(W_str)
        G = int(G_str)
        L = int(L_str)
        if L ==0:
            t = W - G
        else:
            M = W + L - G
            x = W - G
            t = x * (M +1)
        ans = t % MOD
        print(f"Case #{tc}: {ans}")
