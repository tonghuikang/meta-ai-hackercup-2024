To solve this problem, we need to compute the expected number of days, \( E \), it will take to reach the goal weight (\( G \)) from the current weight (\( W \)) under the given constraints.

**Key Observations:**

1. **Upper Limit Constraint:** Your weight cannot exceed any of your previous weights plus \( L \). Formally, at any day, your allowed weight is less than or equal to \(\min_{w' \leq \text{current day}} (w' + L)\).

2. **Weight Evolution:** Each day, your weight can either increase by 1 (if not exceeding the upper limit) or decrease by 1.

3. **Minimum Weight Update:** As you lose weight and reach a new lower weight, your minimum weight (\( w_{\text{min}} \)) updates, which consequently lowers your future maximum allowable weight.

**Deriving the Expected Number of Days:**

From the observations and by analyzing the patterns in the sample inputs and outputs, we find that the expected number of days \( E \) can be expressed as:
\[ E = (W - G) \times (2L + 1) \]

This formula accounts for the fact that for each unit of weight you need to lose (\( W - G \)), the expected time increases proportionally to \( (2L + 1) \), which represents the average number of days considering the possibility of weight fluctuations within the allowed range determined by \( L \).

**Implementation Details:**

- **Modular Arithmetic:** Since \( W \), \( G \), and \( L \) can be very large (up to \( 10^{18} \)), and we're required to output the result modulo \( 998244353 \), we perform modular arithmetic during the computation to keep the numbers manageable.
  
- **Input Parsing:** We read the inputs as strings to prevent any potential issues with integer limitations and convert them to integers when necessary.

- **Multiplication Under Modulo:** We compute \( N = W - G \) and \( K = 2L + 1 \), then compute the final expected days as \( E = (N \mod \text{MOD}) \times (K \mod \text{MOD}) \mod \text{MOD} \).

Here is the Python code implementing the solution:

```python
MOD = 998244353

T = int(input())
for case_num in range(1, T + 1):
    W_str, G_str, L_str = input().split()
    W = int(W_str)
    G = int(G_str)
    L = int(L_str)
    N = W - G
    K = 2 * L + 1
    E = (N % MOD) * (K % MOD) % MOD
    print(f"Case #{case_num}: {E}")
```
