To solve this problem, we analyze the expected number of days required to reach the desired weight \( G \) from the current weight \( W \) under the given constraints.

### Key Findings:

1. **Understanding the Movement**:
   - Each day, there is an equal probability to either increase or decrease your weight by 1 unit.
   - However, there is a constraint that you cannot exceed your minimum weight reached so far plus \( L \).
   
2. **Deriving the Expected Days**:
   - **When \( L = 0 \)**:
     - The only possible action each day is to decrease the weight by 1 unit.
     - Hence, the expected number of days is simply \( W - G \).
   
   - **When \( L > 0 \)**:
     - The problem can be modeled as a symmetric random walk with an absorbing boundary at \( G \) and a reflecting boundary at \( m + L \) (where \( m \) is the minimum weight attained so far).
     - Through analysis, it is derived that the expected number of days is \( (W - G) \times (2L + 1) \).
   
3. **Final Formula**:
   - For any given test case, the expected number of days \( E \) can be computed as:
     \[
     E = (W - G) \times (2L + 1)
     \]
   - Since the problem requires the result modulo \( 998244353 \), we compute \( E \mod 998244353 \).

4. **Handling Modular Arithmetic**:
   - As the expected number of days \( E \) is always an integer in the given context, we don't need to handle fractional parts or modular inverses.

### Python Implementation:

Below is the Python code that implements the above findings. It reads multiple test cases, computes the expected number of days using the derived formula, and outputs the result modulo \( 998244353 \).

```python
import sys

MOD = 998244353

def main():
    import sys
    T = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    for case in range(1, T+1):
        W_str, G_str, L_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()
        W = int(W_str)
        G = int(G_str)
        L = int(L_str)
        delta = W - G
        if L ==0:
            E = delta
        else:
            E = delta * (2 * L +1)
        E %= MOD
        print(f"Case #{case}: {E}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
