To solve this problem, we need to calculate the expected number of days it takes to reach a target weight \( G \) from a current weight \( W \) under certain constraints. Here's a breakdown of the key findings and the approach to solving the problem:

## Key Findings

1. **Base Case (\( L = 0 \))**:
   - When \( L = 0 \), you are not allowed to gain any weight beyond the current weight \( W \). 
   - Therefore, each day, you have a 50% chance to lose 1 unit (which moves you closer to \( G \)) and a 50% chance to attempt to gain 1 unit (which is not allowed, so you must lose 1 unit instead).
   - This makes the process deterministic, and the expected number of days to reach \( G \) is simply \( W - G \).

2. **General Case (\( L > 0 \))**:
   - When \( L > 0 \), you allow some flexibility in gaining weight but with a strict upper limit based on the maximum weight encountered so far.
   - The key observation is that the expected number of days increases linearly with both the weight difference \( (W - G) \) and the flexibility parameter \( L \).
   - Specifically, the formula for the expected number of days when \( L > 0 \) is:
     \[
     \text{Expected Days} = (W - G) \times (2 \times L + 1)
     \]
   - This formula accounts for the variability introduced by the ability to occasionally gain weight without violating the upper limit.

3. **Modular Arithmetic**:
   - Since the expected number of days can be very large (up to \( 10^{36} \)), we compute the result modulo \( 998{,}244{,}353 \) to keep the numbers manageable.
   - The final output is \( \text{Expected Days} \mod 998{,}244{,}353 \).

## Approach

Based on the findings above, the solution involves:

- Reading the number of test cases \( T \).
- For each test case, reading the values of \( W \), \( G \), and \( L \).
- Applying the appropriate formula based on the value of \( L \):
  - If \( L = 0 \), compute \( W - G \).
  - If \( L > 0 \), compute \( (W - G) \times (2 \times L + 1) \).
- Taking the result modulo \( 998{,}244{,}353 \) and printing it in the specified format.

## Python Code

```python
import sys

MOD = 998244353

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    for test_case in range(1, T + 1):
        W = int(data[3 * (test_case - 1) + 1])
        G = int(data[3 * (test_case - 1) + 2])
        L = int(data[3 * (test_case - 1) + 3])
        
        if L == 0:
            E = W - G
        else:
            E = (W - G) * (2 * L + 1)
        
        E_mod = E % MOD
        print(f"Case #{test_case}: {E_mod}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
