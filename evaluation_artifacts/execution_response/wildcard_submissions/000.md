**Key Findings:**

1. **Wildcard Expansion:** Each wildcard string can represent multiple strings by replacing question marks with any uppercase letter. Directly enumerating all possibilities is infeasible due to the exponential number of combinations.

2. **Trie Structure:** A trie efficiently shares common prefixes among different strings, reducing the total number of nodes. By leveraging the trieâ€™s property, we can count unique nodes without explicit enumeration.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach:** Utilize a recursive function with memoization to traverse and build the trie, handling wildcards by iterating over all possible letter replacements at each question mark.

4. **Efficient Node Management:** Represent trie nodes with unique identifiers and use dictionaries to manage transitions between nodes. This ensures that shared prefixes across different strings are counted only once.

5. **Modular Arithmetic:** Since the result needs to be modulo \(998{,}244{,}353\), ensure that all counts are computed using modular operations to prevent overflow and maintain correctness.

6. **Handling Multiple Test Cases:** Given the high number of test cases (\(T \leq 10^5\)), design the solution to process each test case independently and efficiently, ensuring that the overall time complexity remains manageable.

7. **Optimization:** Precompute the number of possible expansions for segments of the strings to avoid redundant calculations, especially when handling consecutive wildcards.
