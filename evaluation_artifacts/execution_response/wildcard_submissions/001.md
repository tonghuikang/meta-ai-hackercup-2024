To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of unique prefixes generated by all possible strings represented by the given wildcard strings, taking into account overlapping prefixes between strings.

**Key Findings:**

1. **Understanding Tries and Prefixes:**
   - A trie is a tree data structure used to store a set of strings where each node represents a prefix of some string.
   - When inserting strings into a trie, overlapping prefixes are shared, which reduces the total number of nodes compared to the sum of the lengths of all strings.

2. **Wildcard Strings and Possible Combinations:**
   - A wildcard character '?' can represent any uppercase English letter, so a wildcard string can represent multiple possible strings.
   - For each wildcard string, at each position, we need to consider all possible letters that can be placed there.

3. **Computing Unique Prefixes:**
   - We need to calculate the total number of unique prefixes generated by all possible strings represented by the wildcard strings.
   - Simply multiplying the number of possible letters at each position can overcount prefixes, especially when overlapping prefixes occur between different strings.

4. **Recursive Trie Construction with Memoization:**
   - We can model the problem as building a trie recursively by considering possible letters at each position across all strings.
   - Memoization is essential to avoid redundant calculations and to handle overlapping prefixes efficiently.
   - The state for memoization can be represented as a tuple of current positions in each string.

5. **Handling Constraints:**
   - With the given constraints (N ≤ 25, string length ≤ 100), we need to efficiently manage the recursion and memoization to ensure that the solution runs within acceptable time limits.
   - By pruning impossible paths and reusing states via memoization, we can significantly reduce the computational overhead.

6. **Implementation Details:**
   - Use a depth-first search (DFS) approach to explore all possible prefixes generated by the wildcard strings.
   - For each recursive call, we consider all possible letters that can be placed at the current positions.
   - We increment the positions for strings that can advance with the chosen letter and keep positions the same for strings that cannot.
   - We keep track of visited states to avoid processing the same state multiple times.

7. **Modulo Operation:**
   - Since the number can be very large, we need to take the modulo 998,244,353 at each step to keep the numbers within manageable limits.

Now, here's the Python code implementing the above approach:

```python
import sys
import threading

def main():
    sys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)
    T = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    MOD = 998244353
    for case_num in range(1, T + 1):
        N = int(sys.stdin.readline())
        S = [sys.stdin.readline().strip() for _ in range(N)]
        max_len = max(len(s) for s in S)
        N_s = len(S)
        memo = {}
        trie_size = 0

        from collections import defaultdict

        def dfs(pos_list):
            nonlocal trie_size
            state_key = tuple(pos_list)
            if state_key in memo:
                return
            memo[state_key] = True
            trie_size += 1

            # Determine possible letters at current positions
            possible_letters = set()
            for i in range(N_s):
                if pos_list[i] < len(S[i]):
                    c = S[i][pos_list[i]]
                    if c == '?':
                        possible_letters.update(chr(ord('A') + k) for k in range(26))
                    else:
                        possible_letters.add(c)

            # For each possible letter, advance positions and recurse
            for c in possible_letters:
                next_pos_list = []
                valid = False
                for i in range(N_s):
                    if pos_list[i] < len(S[i]):
                        s_char = S[i][pos_list[i]]
                        if s_char == '?' or s_char == c:
                            next_pos_list.append(pos_list[i] + 1)
                            valid = True
                        else:
                            next_pos_list.append(pos_list[i])
                    else:
                        next_pos_list.append(pos_list[i])
                if valid:
                    dfs(tuple(next_pos_list))

        # Initialize positions
        initial_pos_list = tuple([0] * N_s)
        dfs(initial_pos_list)

        print(f'Case #{case_num}: {trie_size % MOD}')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    threading.Thread(target=main).start()
```

**Explanation of the Code:**

- **Recursion and Memoization (`dfs` function):**
  - We define a recursive function `dfs` that takes the current positions (`pos_list`) in all strings.
  - We use a dictionary `memo` to keep track of visited states to avoid redundant calculations.
  - We consider all possible letters that can occur at the current positions based on the wildcard characters.
  - For each possible letter, we advance positions in strings where the letter matches and keep positions unchanged where it doesn't.
  - We recurse with the new positions, effectively building the trie and counting the nodes.
  
- **Handling Edge Cases:**
  - If a string has finished (position equals its length), we keep its position unchanged.
  - We only consider letters where at least one string can advance to ensure we don't create invalid paths.

- **Output:**
  - We output the total number of nodes (`trie_size`) modulo 998244353, as per the problem's requirement.

This approach efficiently counts the total number of unique prefixes without overcounting and handles overlapping prefixes correctly, adhering to the problem's constraints.
