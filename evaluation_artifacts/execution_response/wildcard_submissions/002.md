**Key Findings:**

1. **Trie Structure and Wildcards:**
   - A trie is used to store all unique prefixes of strings.
   - Wildcards (`?`) in the input strings represent any uppercase letter, leading to multiple possible expansions for each wildcard string.

2. **Efficient Trie Building:**
   - Instead of expanding all possible strings (which can be computationally expensive), the trie is built by considering all possible characters at each wildcard position.
   - Each node in the trie has up to 26 children, corresponding to each uppercase letter.

3. **Handling Multiple Test Cases:**
   - Given the large number of test cases (`T` up to \(10^5\)), it's crucial to process each test case efficiently.
   - For each test case, a fresh trie is initialized, and all wildcard strings are inserted to compute the number of unique nodes.

4. **Counting Nodes:**
   - The total number of nodes in the trie is incremented each time a new unique prefix is created during the insertion of wildcard-expanded strings.
   - The final count is taken modulo \(998244353\) as per the problem's requirement.

5. **Optimizations:**
   - Use arrays (lists) to represent the trie nodes for faster access and updates.
   - Precompute the possible character indices for each position to streamline the insertion process.
   - Read all input at once and process it efficiently to handle the large number of test cases within acceptable time limits.
