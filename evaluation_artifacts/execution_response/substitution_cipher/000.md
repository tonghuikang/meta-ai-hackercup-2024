**Key Findings:**

1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Approach:** To determine the number of ways to decode the string, a DP approach is essential. The DP array will keep track of the number of decoding ways up to each position in the string.

2. **Handling Corrupted Characters:** Each '?' can be replaced with any digit from '0' to '9'. To maximize the number of decodings, we need to choose replacements that allow both single-digit and two-digit splits wherever possible. This involves selecting digits that make individual digits and pairs (when combined with adjacent digits) valid (i.e., between 1 and 26).

3. **Maximizing Decodings:** For each position, we evaluate all possible digit replacements for '?' to maximize the decoding count. This requires considering how each replacement affects the current and future split options.

4. **Counting Optimal Uncorrupted Strings:** Alongside maximizing decodings, we must count how many uncorrupted strings achieve this maximum. This involves tracking the number of valid replacements at each '?' that contribute to the maximal decoding paths.

5. **Lexicographical Ordering for Kth Largest:** To find the lexicographically \(K\)th largest string among those that achieve the maximum number of decodings, we perform a greedy selection. Starting from the left, at each '?', we choose the highest possible digit that still allows the remaining string to achieve the maximum decoding count, effectively constructing the lexicographically largest string first and navigating towards the \(K\)th variation as needed.

6. **Efficient Implementation:** Given the constraints (especially the large size of input strings), the solution must be optimized for performance. This includes precomputing possible digit replacements and using efficient data structures to avoid redundant calculations.

The combination of these strategies ensures that the solution efficiently identifies the optimal uncorrupted string and accurately determines its lexicographical position among all possible optimal strings.

        # It seems the above approach might not directly work

        # Alternative approach:
        # To maximize the number of decodings, we need to maximize the number of ways to split the string
        # That typically means maximizing the number of places where a split can occur

        # So, to maximize, choose digits that are between '1' and '9', and when possible, pairs that are between '10' and '26'

        # So, to maximize DP, when encountering '?', set it to '1' or '2' (to allow two-digit)

        # Let's adjust the strategy:
        # Assign to each '?' the digit that maximizes the number of splits
        # But need to ensure that the overall number of splits is maximized

        # A better idea is to perform DP where at each step, we choose the digit that allows the most splits

        # Therefore, it's better to first compute the maximum number of decodings possible, and then count and enumerate the strings that achieve it
