        # which typically means allowing both single and two-digit splits where possible
        # So, to maximize, we prefer digits that allow two-digit splits
        # For each position, decide the digit that maximizes the number of ways
        
        # However, it's complicated to decide greedily, so instead, we can:
        # Enumerate all possible digits, compute the decoding count, track the maximum
        
        # But with E length up to 1e5, we need a better approach
        # Instead, realize that the DP count depends on digit choices,
        # and to maximize it, we need at each step to choose digits that allow
        # more possibilities (prefer digits that can be both single and can form two-digit with previous)
        
        # So, to maximize the decoding count, we'd prefer:
        # - At each '?', choose a digit that does not limit decoding options
        # - For example, avoid '0' unless it's part of a valid two-digit number
        
        # To construct such a string, we can replace '?' with '1', because '1' can be part of many two-digit numbers (10-19)
        # Or '2', which allows 20-26
        # To maximize, maybe prefer digits that allow both single and two-digit decodings

        # To find lex smallest or largest, but here we need lex Kth largest
        
        # Alternative approach:
        # To maximize the number of decodings, we need the DP count to be maximum
        # Since DP[i] depends on DP[i-1] and DP[i-2], the number of ways can be exponentially large
        # To maximize DP[i], for each position, we want as many transitions as possible
        # which happens when the current digit allows single-digit decoding, and with previous digit, allows two-digit decoding

        # So, to maximize, replace '?' with digits that are not '0'.
        # But still, need to maximize the transitions
        # It might not be straightforward, but since the problem asks to find among all possible uncorrupted strings
        # the one with the maximum decoding count, and then find the Kth lex largest, here is a possible plan:

        # Implement a DP-based approach where for each position, track:
        # - The maximum number of decodings up to that position
        # - The set of possible digits that can lead to that maximum
        # Then construct the lex Kth largest string accordingly

        # However, storing sets is too heavy. Instead, for each position, store the maximum decoding count
        # and the number of ways to achieve that count.

        # To find the maximum decoding count, proceed with replacing '?' optimally
        # Then, to find the lex Kth largest, perform a backtracking, choosing digits in reverse order to get largest lex

        # Implement DP to compute the maximum decoding count and number of uncorrupted strings achieving it
        # Then, collect the possible digits at each position that contribute to the maximum count
        # Finally, perform a Kth lex largest selection based on these choices
