        # But a_count up to N=50 and b_count up to M=5, and score up to L=1e9
        # Which is infeasible.

        # Since A's are identical in terms of grouping (but not, since they have distinct values)
        # Maybe to arrange A's in a certain fixed order to reduce complexity

        # Use DP with last piece type and some group properties
        # But it's tricky.

        # Practical Approach:
        # Given tight constraints, and small M, assume B's must be placed consecutively
        # and compute the number of ways to arrange A's and B's accordingly.

        # Number of ways to arrange A's and B's is C(N+M, M) * N! * M!

        # To minimize the sum, place B's together and A's in sorted order
        # To maximize the sum, place B's far from A's.

        # Since L can be up to 1e9, and differences involving B's can be up to 1e9,
        # it's too complex to handle normally.
        # Thus, to implement a DP where position is decided step by step.
