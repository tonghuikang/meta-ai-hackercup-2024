**Key Findings:**

1. **Peak Identification:**
   - **Structure:** A peak number has \(2k + 1\) digits, forming a palindromic pattern where the first \(k+1\) digits increment by 1, and the last \(k+1\) digits decrement by 1.
   - **Single-Digit Peaks:** All single-digit numbers from 1 to 9 are peaks (\(k=0\)).
   - **Multi-Digit Peaks:** For \(k \geq 1\), peaks are constructed by choosing a starting digit \(d\) such that \(1 \leq d \leq 9 - k\) to ensure no digit exceeds 9 or becomes zero. The peak is then built as a sequence of increasing digits followed by decreasing digits.

2. **Precomputation:**
   - **Limited Number of Peaks:** Given the constraints (up to 19 digits), the total number of peaks is manageable (approximately 45 peaks).
   - **Sorted List:** Precompute and sort all possible peak numbers to facilitate efficient range queries using binary search.

3. **Handling Test Cases:**
   - For each test case with range \([A, B]\) and integer \(M\):
     - **Range Filtering:** Utilize binary search to identify all peaks within the range \([A, B]\).
     - **Modulo Check:** Count the number of peaks within this range that are divisible by \(M\).

4. **Efficiency:**
   - Given the small number of peaks and the constraints on \(T\) (number of test cases), the approach is efficient and feasible within the provided limits.

**Python Code:**

```python
import sys
import bisect

def generate_peaks():
    peaks = []
    # k=0: single-digit peaks
    for d in range(1, 10):
        peaks.append(d)
    # k >=1
    for k in range(1, 9):  # k from1 to8, since 2*8+1=17 digits
        for d in range(1, 10 - k):  # d from1 to9 -k
            # Build the increasing part
            increasing = [d + i for i in range(k +1)]
            # Build the decreasing part
            decreasing = [d + k - i for i in range(1, k +1)]
            number_digits = increasing + decreasing
            # Convert to integer
            number = 0
            for digit in number_digits:
                number = number *10 + digit
            peaks.append(number)
    peaks.sort()
    return peaks

def count_peaks_in_range(peaks, A, B):
    left = bisect.bisect_left(peaks, A)
    right = bisect.bisect_right(peaks, B)
    return peaks[left:right]
