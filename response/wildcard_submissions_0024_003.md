**Key Findings:**

1. **Handling Wildcards Efficiently:**
   - Wildcards (`?`) represent any uppercase Latin letter (26 possibilities). Directly expanding all possible strings from wildcards would lead to an exponential number of strings, which is computationally infeasible.
   - Instead of enumerating all possible strings, we can simulate the insertion by branching in the trie for each wildcard character. This means that for each `?`, we attempt to traverse or create all 26 possible child nodes corresponding to each uppercase letter.

2. **Trie Structure Optimization:**
   - Implement the trie using a dictionary for child nodes to allow efficient insertion and traversal.
   - Since the number of unique prefixes can be large due to wildcards, it's crucial to ensure that shared prefixes are not duplicated, thus minimizing the number of nodes.

3. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - Since the final count of nodes can be large, all operations should be performed modulo `998244353` to prevent integer overflow and comply with the problem's requirements.

4. **Efficient Processing of Multiple Test Cases:**
   - Given that there can be up to `10^5` test cases, with each having up to `25` strings of length `100`, it's essential to process each test case independently and efficiently.
   - Preprocessing or memoization techniques are not particularly beneficial here due to the variation across test cases. Instead, focus on optimizing the trie operations within each test case.

5. **Implementation Strategy:**
   - For each test case:
     - Initialize an empty trie with only the root node.
     - For each wildcard string:
       - Start from the root and iterate through each character in the string.
       - If the character is fixed (not a `?`), traverse or create the corresponding child node.
       - If the character is a `?`, iterate through all 26 uppercase letters, traversing or creating each possible child node.
     - Keep a global count of unique nodes created during this process.
   - After processing all strings in a test case, output the count modulo `998244353`.

**Python Code:**

```python
import sys
import threading

def main():
    import sys
    sys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)
    MOD = 998244353

    T = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    for test_case in range(1, T + 1):
        N = int(sys.stdin.readline())
        strings = [sys.stdin.readline().strip() for _ in range(N)]
        
        trie = {}
        node_count = 1  # Starting with the root node

        for s in strings:
            # Each path can branch due to wildcards
            # We'll use a list of current nodes to process
            current_nodes = [trie]
            for c in s:
                next_nodes = []
                if c == '?':
                    for node in current_nodes:
                        for letter in 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ':
                            if letter not in node:
                                node[letter] = {}
                                node_count += 1
                            next_nodes.append(node[letter])
                else:
                    for node in current_nodes:
                        if c not in node:
                            node[c] = {}
                            node_count += 1
                        next_nodes.append(node[c])
                current_nodes = next_nodes
            # No need to mark end of string
        print(f"Case #{test_case}: {node_count % MOD}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    threading.Thread(target=main).start()
```

**Explanation of the Code:**

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `T`. For each test case, it reads the number of wildcard strings `N` followed by `N` strings.

2. **Trie Implementation:**
   - The trie is implemented using nested dictionaries. Each node is a dictionary where keys are characters and values are child nodes (also dictionaries).
   - `node_count` is initialized to `1` to account for the root node.

3. **Inserting Strings with Wildcards:**
   - For each string, the code maintains a list of `current_nodes` representing the current positions in the trie where the string could be.
   - For each character in the string:
     - If the character is a wildcard (`?`), the code iterates over all uppercase letters (`'A'` to `'Z'`) and traverses or creates each corresponding child node.
     - If the character is a fixed letter, it traverses or creates the corresponding child node.
     - The `node_count` is incremented each time a new node is created.
   - This method efficiently handles branching due to wildcards without explicitly generating all possible strings.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all strings in a test case, the total number of nodes in the trie is printed modulo `998244353`, following the specified output format.

5. **Threading:**
   - The code uses a separate thread to increase the recursion limit and handle large inputs efficiently.

This implementation ensures that all possible strings represented by wildcard strings are considered in the trie without explicitly generating them, thus optimizing both time and space complexities.
