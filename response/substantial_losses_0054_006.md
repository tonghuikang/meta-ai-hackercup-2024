**Key Findings:**

1. **Base Case (L = 0):**  
   When the constraint `L` is zero, you cannot gain any weight. Therefore, the weight must decrease by 1 unit each day deterministically. The expected number of days to reach the goal weight `G` from `W` is simply the difference `D = W - G`.

2. **General Case (L > 0):**  
   When `L` is greater than zero, there's a possibility to occasionally gain weight, but with the constraint that you cannot exceed `w + L` for any historical weight `w`. Through analysis, it is determined that the expected number of days to reach `G` from `W` is given by the formula:
   \[
   E = D \times (2L + 1)
   \]
   where `D = W - G`.

3. **Modular Arithmetic Consideration:**  
   Since the expected number of days can be very large (up to \(10^{36}\)), computing the result modulo \(998{,}244{,}353\) is essential. For cases where `L = 0`, the result is simply `D % 998244353`. For `L > 0`, the result is `(D * (2 * L + 1)) % 998244353`.

4. **Handling Large Inputs Efficiently:**  
   Given the large constraints (up to \(10^{18}\)), the formula allows computation in constant time per test case, avoiding the need for iterative or recursive methods that would be computationally infeasible.

5. **Output Format:**  
   Since the expected number of days `E` is an integer in both cases (`L = 0` and `L > 0`), the output can be directly printed as `E % 998244353` without the need for modular inverses.

**Python Code:**

```python
MOD = 998244353

def compute_expected_days(W, G, L):
    D = W - G
    if L == 0:
        return D % MOD
    else:
        two_L_plus_one = (2 * L +1) % MOD
        D_mod = D % MOD
        return (D_mod * two_L_plus_one) % MOD

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    T = int(data[0])
    for i in range(1, T+1):
        W, G, L = map(int, data[(i-1)*3 +1 : i*3 +1])
        result = compute_expected_days(W, G, L)
        print(f"Case #{i}: {result}")

    main()
