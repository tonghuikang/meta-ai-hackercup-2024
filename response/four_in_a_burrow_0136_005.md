To solve this problem, we'll analyze the final Connect Four grid to determine the earliest possible move numbers for each cell, under the game's constraints, and figure out who must have won first.

**Key findings and steps:**

1. **Players' Turn Order and Constraints:**
   - Connie (C) moves on odd-numbered turns (1, 3, 5, ...).
   - Forrest (F) moves on even-numbered turns (2, 4, 6, ...).
   - Cells are filled from bottom to top in each column.
   - In the same column, the cell above must have a move number greater than the one below.
   - No two cells can have the same move number.
   - Players cannot have two moves in a row in the same column without the other player moving in between.

2. **Assigning Earliest Possible Move Numbers:**
   - For each cell, we'll assign the earliest possible move number (E[r][c]), given the constraints.
   - The assignment considers:
     - The player (C or F) who owns the cell.
     - The moves must alternate between players.
     - Vertical constraints within a column (cells above must have higher move numbers).

3. **Algorithm for Assigning Earliest Move Numbers:**
   - Iterate through each column from bottom to top.
   - For each cell:
     - If it's the bottom cell, assign 1 for C or 2 for F.
     - For cells above:
       - If the cell below is the same player, move number increases by at least 2.
       - If the cell below is a different player, move number increases by at least 1.
     - Adjust the move number to ensure it's the correct parity (odd for C, even for F).

4. **Identifying Winning Lines:**
   - After assigning move numbers, we search for all winning lines (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal sequences of four identical markers).
   - For each winning line, we record the maximum move number among its four cells. This represents the earliest possible turn when that winning line could have been completed.

5. **Determining Who Won First:**
   - For each player, find the minimum move number among all their winning lines.
   - Compare the earliest winning moves:
     - If Connie's earliest winning move is before Forrest's, Connie must have won first.
     - If Forrest's earliest winning move is before Connie's, Forrest must have won first.
     - If they are the same, it's impossible to tell who won first.
     - If neither has a winning line, nobody has won.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - Handle situations where multiple winning lines exist.
   - Ensure the move numbers do not exceed the total number of moves (42).

7. **Implementation:**
   - Use a 6x7 grid to represent the game board.
   - Use array manipulations and careful indexing (taking into account that the bottom row corresponds to index 5).
   - Check all possible directions for winning lines (horizontal, vertical, and both diagonals).
   - Use Pythonâ€™s data structures for efficient computation.

Now, here is the Python code implementing the solution:

    grid = []

        grid.append(list(input().strip()))
    # Since the bottom row is the southernmost (index 5)
    # We'll process the grid and assign earliest possible move numbers
    
    E = [[None]*7 for _ in range(6)]  # Earliest possible move numbers
    for c in range(7):
        E_prev = 0
        player_prev = None
        for r in range(5, -1, -1):  # from bottom to top
