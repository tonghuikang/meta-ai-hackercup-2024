**Key Findings:**

1. **Understanding the Process:**
   - We start at weight \( W \) and aim to reach \( G \) where \( G < W \).
   - Each day, weight either increases or decreases by 1 unit with equal probability unless constrained by the limit \( L \).

2. **Constraint Implication:**
   - If the weight has ever been \( w \), the weight can never exceed \( w + L \) in the future.
   - This effectively sets a dynamic upper bound based on the minimum weight achieved so far.

3. **Expected Days Calculation:**
   - Through analysis of sample cases and pattern observation, it becomes evident that the expected number of days to reach \( G \) from \( W \) can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Expected Days} = (W - G) \times (2L + 1)
     \]
   - This formula aligns with the sample inputs provided and efficiently handles large values of \( W \), \( G \), and \( L \).

4. **Modulo Operation:**
   - Since the expected number of days can be very large, the result needs to be computed modulo \( 998244353 \).
   - This is achieved by performing modular multiplication to ensure the result fits within the required constraints.

5. **Implementation Considerations:**
   - Python's arbitrary-precision integers handle large computations seamlessly.
   - Efficient computation of large numbers modulo \( 998244353 \) is crucial for performance, especially given the constraints.

**Python Code:**

```python
import sys

MOD = 998244353

def main():
    import sys
    import math
    T = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    for case in range(1, T+1):
        W_str, G_str, L_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()
        W = int(W_str)
        G = int(G_str)
        L = int(L_str)
        delta = W - G
        factor = (2 * L + 1) % MOD
        delta_mod = delta % MOD
        expected = (delta_mod * factor) % MOD
        print(f"Case #{case}: {expected}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
