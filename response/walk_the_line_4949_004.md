**Key Findings:**

1. **Problem Transformation:**
   - The problem is a variant of the classic bridge-crossing puzzle, where travelers must cross a bridge with limited capacity and shared resources (flashlight and wheelbarrow).
   - The introduction of the wheelbarrow allows two travelers to cross with the time taken by the faster traveler, optimizing the total crossing time.

2. **Strategy Optimization:**
   - **Sorting:** Begin by sorting the travelers based on their crossing times in ascending order. This allows for efficient pairing and decision-making.
   - **Greedy Approach:** Use a greedy strategy similar to the standard bridge-crossing problem, but adjusted for the wheelbarrow's capabilities.
   - **Two Main Strategies:**
     - **Strategy 1:** 
       1. The two fastest travelers cross together.
       2. The fastest returns with the flashlight.
       3. The two slowest travelers cross together.
       4. The second fastest returns with the flashlight.
     - **Strategy 2:**
       1. The fastest and the slowest traveler cross together.
       2. The fastest returns with the flashlight.
       3. The fastest and the second slowest traveler cross together.
       4. The fastest returns with the flashlight.
   - **Choice of Strategy:** At each step, choose the strategy that minimizes the total time based on the current set of travelers.

3. **Efficiency Considerations:**
   - Since the number of travelers \( N \) can be up to \( 1{,}000 \), the algorithm must be efficient. Sorting and a linear pass ensure an overall \( O(N \log N) \) time complexity per test case.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Single Traveler:** If there's only one traveler, they simply cross alone.
   - **Two Travelers:** They can cross together using the wheelbarrow.
   - **Large K Values:** Ensure that the total calculated time does not exceed the maximum allowed time \( K \).

5. **Implementation:**
   - Implement the above strategies iteratively, updating the total time and reducing the number of travelers on the initial side accordingly.
   - After calculating the minimal total time, compare it with \( K \) to determine if the crossing is feasible.

**Python Code:**

```python
import sys

def minimal_time(N, S):
    S.sort()
    total_time = 0
    i = N - 1
    while i >= 0:
        if i == 0:
            # Only one person left
            total_time += S[0]
            i -= 1
        elif i == 1:
            # Two people left
            total_time += S[0]
            i -= 2
        elif i == 2:
            # Three people left
            total_time += S[0] + S[1] + S[2]
            i -= 3
        else:
            # More than three people left
            # Strategy 1: S[0] carries S[i] and S[i-1], then S[0] returns
            strategy1 = S[i-1] + S[i] + S[0] + S[i-1]
            # Strategy 2: S[0] and S[1] carry S[i] and S[i-1], then S[1] returns
            strategy2 = S[1] + S[0] + S[i] + S[1]
            total_time += min(strategy1, strategy2)
            i -= 2
    return total_time
