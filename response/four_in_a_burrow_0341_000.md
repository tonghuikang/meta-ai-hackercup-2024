**Key Findings:**

To determine who won first in the final Connect Four grid, we need to reconstruct the sequence of moves while respecting the game's rules:

1. **Grid Representation:**
   - The input grid is provided with the top row first and the bottom row last. For processing, we reverse the grid so that `row 0` represents the bottom row.

2. **Move Number Assignment:**
   - Each cell in a column must be filled from the bottom up. The minimum move number (`min_move`) for a cell at column `c` and row `r` is `r + 1`, since the cells below must be filled first.
   - **Connie (C)** makes moves on odd-numbered turns (1, 3, 5, ...), and **Forrest (F)** makes moves on even-numbered turns (2, 4, 6, ...).
   - The earliest **C** can achieve a four-in-a-row is on move 7 (after placing four burrows), and the earliest **F** can achieve it is on move 8.

3. **Identifying Four-in-a-Rows:**
   - We search for all possible horizontal, vertical, and diagonal four-in-a-row sequences for both **C** and **F**.
   - For each four-in-a-row sequence:
     - Determine the latest `min_move` among the four cells.
     - Calculate the earliest possible completion move:
       - For **C**, it's the next odd move ≥ this maximum.
       - For **F**, it's the next even move ≥ this maximum.
   - Track the minimal completion move for both **C** and **F** across all their respective four-in-a-row sequences.

4. **Determining the Winner:**
   - If only **C** has a four-in-a-row, **C** is the winner.
   - If only **F** has a four-in-a-row, **F** is the winner.
   - If both have four-in-a-rows:
     - If **C's** minimal completion move is earlier than **F's**, **C** wins.
     - If **F's** minimal completion move is earlier, **F** wins.
     - If both can achieve their four-in-a-row on the same earliest move, it's ambiguous (`?`).
   - If neither has a four-in-a-row, the result is `0`.

This approach ensures that we respect the game's mechanics and accurately determine who achieved a four-in-a-row first based on the final grid state.
