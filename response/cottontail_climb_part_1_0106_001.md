The key findings when solving this problem are:

- **Observation of the "Peak" Pattern**: A "peak" number follows a specific pattern where digits increase by 1 up to a certain point and then decrease by 1 symmetrically. This pattern allows us to generate peaks systematically.

- **Manageable Number of Peaks**: Despite the potentially large range of numbers up to \(10^{18}\), the total number of peaks is relatively small (45 peaks). This is because the starting digit \(D_1\) is constrained by \(1 \leq D_1 \leq 9 - k\) for each \(k\).

- **Efficient Precomputation**: We can precompute all possible peaks once and reuse them for each test case. Since the number of peaks is small, this approach is efficient and avoids unnecessary computations during each test case.

- **Filtering Peaks**: For each test case, we can filter the precomputed peaks to find those that lie within the given range \([A, B]\) and are divisible by \(M\). This simplifies the problem to a straightforward search within a small dataset.

Here is the Python code implementing the solution:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import sys

def generate_peaks():
    peaks = []
    for k in range(0, 9):  # k from 0 to 8
        for D1 in range(1, 10 - k):
            # Generate the increasing part
            digits_up = [D1 + i for i in range(k + 1)]
            # Generate the decreasing part (exclude the peak digit to avoid duplication)
            digits_down = digits_up[:-1][::-1]
            digits = digits_up + digits_down
            # Convert digits to number
            number = int(''.join(map(str, digits)))
            peaks.append(number)
    peaks.sort()
    return peaks

def main():
    import sys
    import threading

    def run():
        peaks = generate_peaks()
        T = int(sys.stdin.readline())
        for case_num in range(1, T + 1):
            line = sys.stdin.readline()
            while line.strip() == '':
                line = sys.stdin.readline()
            A_str, B_str, M_str = line.strip().split()
            A = int(A_str)
            B = int(B_str)
            M = int(M_str)
            count = 0
            for peak in peaks:
                if peak < A:
                    continue
                if peak > B:
                    break
                if peak % M == 0:
                    count += 1
            print(f"Case #{case_num}: {count}")

    threading.Thread(target=run).start()

    main()
