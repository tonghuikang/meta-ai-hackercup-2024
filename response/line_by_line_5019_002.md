**Key Findings:**

1. **Understanding the Probability:**
   - The probability of successfully typing all \( N \) lines correctly with an original success rate \( P\% \) per line is \( \left(\frac{P}{100}\right)^N \).
   - If you decide to type only \( N-1 \) lines, the probability of success is \( \left(\frac{P}{100}\right)^{N-1} \).

2. **Equating Success Probabilities:**
   - To make typing \( N \) lines as successful as typing \( N-1 \) lines with the original \( P\% \), we set:
     \[
     \left(\frac{P_{\text{new}}}{100}\right)^N = \left(\frac{P}{100}\right)^{N-1}
     \]
   - Solving for \( P_{\text{new}} \):
     \[
     P_{\text{new}} = \left(\frac{P}{100}\right)^{\frac{N-1}{N}} \times 100
     \]
   - The required increase in \( P \) is:
     \[
     \text{Increase} = P_{\text{new}} - P
     \]

3. **Implementation Considerations:**
   - Handle floating-point precision carefully to ensure the output meets the required accuracy.
   - Use logarithms or exponentiation functions to compute \( P_{\text{new}} \).

**Python Code:**

```python
import math
import sys

def main():
    T = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    for case in range(1, T + 1):
        parts = sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()
        if len(parts) < 2:
            # In case of empty lines or insufficient parts
            while len(parts) < 2:
                parts += sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()
        N, P = map(int, parts)
        original_prob = P / 100.0
        if original_prob == 0.0:
            # If original P is 0%, any increase is needed to get a positive probability
            # But since P starts from 1%, per constraints, this should not happen
            new_P = 100.0
        else:
            exponent = (N - 1) / N
            new_prob = original_prob ** exponent
            new_P = new_prob * 100.0
        increase = new_P - P
        # Ensure that small negative values due to floating point are treated as zero
        if increase < 0:
            increase = 0.0
        print(f"Case #{case}: {increase}")
