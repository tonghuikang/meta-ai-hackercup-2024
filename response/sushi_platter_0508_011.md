**Key Findings:**

1. **Problem Structure:**
   - We need to count the number of permutations of \(N + M\) sushi pieces where the "unevenness score" \(S(P)\) does not exceed \(L\).
   - Each permutation involves arranging both nigiri (with tastiness values \(A_i \leq 100\)) and sashimi (with tastiness values \(B_i \geq 101\)).

2. **Constraints Analysis:**
   - \(N\) can be up to 50, and \(M\) is small (up to 5). This suggests that optimizations can be made based on the small value of \(M\).
   - The large value of \(L\) (up to \(10^9\)) and the possible large differences between sashimi pieces (up to nearly \(10^9\)) pose challenges for traditional dynamic programming approaches that track the sum of differences.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - **State Representation:**
     - Use a bitmask to represent which sashimi have been used (since \(M \leq 5\), a 5-bit mask suffices).
     - Track the last piece used to calculate the next difference.
     - Keep a compressed representation of the accumulated sum to avoid memory issues, possibly using heuristic pruning.
   - **Transitions:**
     - At each step, decide whether to place a nigiri or a sashimi next.
     - Update the sum of differences accordingly.
     - Prune paths where the sum exceeds \(L\).
   - **Optimizations:**
     - Given the small \(M\), iterate over all possible orders of sashimi (there are \(M! \leq 120\) permutations).
     - Use memoization and dynamic programming techniques to efficiently explore feasible permutations without exhaustively enumerating all possibilities.

4. **Handling Large Sum Values:**
   - Due to the potential for very large differences (especially between sashimi), managing the cumulative sum of differences is crucial.
   - Implementing an efficient way to track and update these sums without exceeding memory constraints is essential, potentially by limiting the sum tracking to only necessary states.

5. **Final Computation:**
   - After iterating through all feasible states and transitions, accumulate the total number of valid permutations that satisfy \(S(P) \leq L\).
   - Ensure that the result is computed modulo \(1{,}000{,}000{,}007\) due to the potential size of the output.

Below is the Python code implementing the above approach:

            # We can model this as placing the nigiri in M+1 segments
            # For each segment, arrange the nigiri in any order
            # The total differences would be the sum within segments plus the transitions
            # between segments and sashimi
            # Since M is small, implement DP per segment
            # Initialize DP: for each gap, track possible sums
