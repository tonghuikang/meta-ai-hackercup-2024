**Key Findings:**

1. **Definition Clarification**: An *N-subtractorization* is a prime number \( p \leq N \) that can be expressed as the difference of two primes \( q \) and \( r \) such that \( q, r \leq N \) and \( p = q - r \).

2. **Prime Types**:
    - **Even Prime (\( p = 2 \))**: \( p = 2 \) can be expressed as the difference of two odd primes (e.g., \( 5 - 3 = 2 \)). This requires at least one **twin prime pair** (pairs of primes that differ by 2, such as (3,5), (5,7), etc.) to exist within the range \( \leq N \).
    - **Odd Primes**: For an odd prime \( p \), it can be expressed as \( p = q - 2 \), where \( q = p + 2 \) must also be a prime \( \leq N \). This essentially means that every such \( p \) forms a twin prime pair with \( q \).

3. **Counting Strategy**:
    - **Twin Primes**: Precompute all twin prime pairs up to the maximum \( N \) across all test cases. Each twin prime pair contributes to the count of subtractorizations.
    - **Subtractorization Count**:
        - For each test case with a given \( N \):
            - Count the number of twin prime pairs \( (p, p+2) \) where \( p + 2 \leq N \).
            - If at least one twin prime pair exists, include \( p = 2 \) as a valid subtractorization.
            - The total number of subtractorizations is thus the number of twin prime pairs plus one (for \( p = 2 \)) if any twin primes exist.

4. **Efficiency Considerations**:
    - Utilize the **Sieve of Eratosthenes** to efficiently generate all primes up to the maximum \( N \) (which can be up to \( 10^7 \)).
    - Use cumulative counting to quickly determine the number of twin prime pairs up to any \( N \).

Here's the Python implementation based on these findings:

```python
import sys
import sys
import sys

def main():
    import sys
    import sys
    from sys import stdin
    import sys

    import sys

    def input():
        return sys.stdin.read()

    data = input().split()
    T = int(data[0])
    N_list = list(map(int, data[1:T+1]))
    max_N = max(N_list) if T >0 else 0
    sieve_size = max_N +1

    # Initialize sieve
    sieve = [True] * sieve_size
    sieve[0]=False
    sieve[1]=False

    import math
    sqrt_max = int(math.isqrt(max_N)) +1
    for p in range(2, sqrt_max):
        if sieve[p]:
            for multiple in range(p*p, sieve_size, p):
                sieve[multiple]=False

    # Compute twin prime counts
    twin_counts = [0]*(sieve_size)
    twin_count =0
    for i in range(3, sieve_size):
        if sieve[i] and sieve[i-2]:
            twin_count +=1
        twin_counts[i] = twin_count

    # For i <3, twin_counts is 0
    for i in range(0,3):
        twin_counts[i]=0

    # Process each test case
    for idx in range(T):
        N = N_list[idx]
        if N <2:
            count =0
        else:
            if N >=3:
                twin_count_N = twin_counts[N]
            else:
                twin_count_N =0
            if twin_count_N >=1:
                count = twin_count_N +1
            else:
                count =0
        print(f"Case #{idx+1}: {count}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
