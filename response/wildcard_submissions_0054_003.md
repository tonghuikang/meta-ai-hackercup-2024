**Key Findings:**

To solve the problem, the goal is to efficiently count the number of unique nodes in a trie constructed from multiple wildcard strings. Here are the key considerations and strategies used:

1. **Trie Construction:** 
   - A trie is built where each node represents a unique prefix.
   - Wildcard characters (`?`) in the strings introduce branching, meaning each `?` can be replaced by any uppercase letter from `A` to `Z`.

2. **Efficient Node Management:**
   - Instead of using nested dictionaries (which are slow in Python), the trie is implemented using a list of lists. Each node contains a list of 26 elements corresponding to each uppercase letter.
   - Nodes are indexed numerically to allow constant-time access and updates.

3. **Handling Multiple Strings:**
   - For each string, the algorithm traverses the trie, branching out whenever a wildcard is encountered by iterating through all possible letter replacements.
   - Duplicate nodes are avoided by checking if a transition for a particular letter already exists. If not, a new node is created.

4. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Given the potentially large number of test cases (up to 10^5) and strings per test case, the solution ensures that each operation within a test case is optimized for speed.
   - By avoiding redundant operations and utilizing fast list operations, the algorithm remains efficient even with the high input constraints.

5. **Modulo Operation:**
   - Since the number of nodes can be very large, all counts are computed modulo `998244353` to keep the numbers manageable and fit within integer limits.

**Python Code:**

```python
import sys
import sys
import sys
def main():
    import sys
    import sys
    sys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)
    MOD = 998244353
    T = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    for test_case in range(1, T + 1):
        N = int(sys.stdin.readline())
        strings = [sys.stdin.readline().strip() for _ in range(N)]
        node_list = [ [-1] * 26 ]
        node_count = 1
        for S in strings:
            current_nodes = [0]
            for ch in S:
                if ch == '?':
                    letters = list(range(26))
                else:
                    letters = [ord(ch) - ord('A')]
                next_nodes = []
                for node in current_nodes:
                    for l in letters:
                        child = node_list[node][l]
                        if child == -1:
                            node_list.append([ -1 ] * 26)
                            node_list[node][l] = node_count
                            child = node_count
                            node_count +=1
                        next_nodes.append(child)
                # Remove duplicates by converting to set and back to list
                current_nodes = list(set(next_nodes))
        print(f"Case #{test_case}: {node_count % MOD}")
