**Key Findings:**

1. **Snake Representation:** Despite the snake's length \( N \) being up to \( 10^9 \), it's impractical to track each cell individually. Instead, we can represent the snake's body using segments that capture direction changes and lengths.

2. **Movement Simulation:** The snake's movement can be broken down into segments based on its direction. Each move involves a direction change (left, right, or straight) followed by a forward movement of \( X_i \) units.

3. **Tracking Head and Tail:** 
    - **Head Position:** We need to track the head's position and current direction after each move.
    - **Tail Position:** The tail follows the head with a delay of \( N \) units of movement. By maintaining the segments in a queue, we can efficiently determine the tail's position by dequeuing segments as the head progresses.

4. **Bounding Rectangle:**
    - To calculate \( A(t) \), the area of the smallest axis-aligned rectangle covering the snake at time \( t \), we need to track the minimum and maximum \( x \) and \( y \) coordinates of all the segments currently occupied by the snake.
    - As the head moves and new segments are added, we update the min/max coordinates.
    - As the tail moves and old segments are removed, we adjust the min/max coordinates accordingly.

5. **Efficient Computation of \( f(i) \):**
    - For each move \( i \), we need to determine the minimum area \( f(i) \) during the move's duration.
    - Since area changes occur only when the min or max \( x \) or \( y \) coordinates change, we can track these events and determine the minimum area without checking every single time unit.

6. **Modular Arithmetic:** Since the sum of \( f(i) \) can be very large, all computations should be done modulo \( 1{,}000{,}000{,}007 \) to prevent integer overflow and to conform to the problem's requirements.
