To solve this problem, we need to determine how much the probability \(P\) should be increased to ensure that typing \(N\) lines of code with the new probability \(P'\) has the same success rate as typing \(N-1\) lines with the original probability \(P\).

### Key Findings:

1. **Understanding the Success Rates:**
   - The probability of successfully typing \(N\) lines with probability \(P\) per line is \((P/100)^N\).
   - The probability of successfully typing \(N-1\) lines with the same probability \(P\) per line is \((P/100)^{N-1}\).

2. **Setting Up the Equation:**
   - We need to find \(P'\) such that \((P'/100)^N = (P/100)^{N-1}\).
   - Solving for \(P'\), we get:
     \[
     P' = \left(\frac{P}{100}\right)^{\frac{N-1}{N}} \times 100
     \]
   
3. **Calculating the Increase:**
   - The required increase in \(P\) is simply \(P' - P\).

4. **Handling Large Exponents:**
   - For large values of \(N\), directly computing \(P^{N-1}\) can lead to overflow issues. 
   - Instead, we use logarithms to compute the required probability accurately.

5. **Precision:**
   - To ensure the answer is within an absolute or relative error of \(10^{-6}\), we perform calculations using floating-point arithmetic and output the result with sufficient decimal places.

### Python Implementation:

```python
import math

def calculate_delta_P(N, P):
    if P == 0:
        return 100.0  # If P is 0%, you need to increase it to 100%
    P_frac = P / 100.0
    exponent = (N - 1) / N
    P_new_frac = math.pow(P_frac, exponent)
    P_new = P_new_frac * 100.0
    delta_P = P_new - P
    return delta_P

def main():
    import sys
    T_and_cases = sys.stdin.read().strip().split()
    T = int(T_and_cases[0])
    idx = 1
    for test_case in range(1, T +1):
        N = int(T_and_cases[idx])
        P = int(T_and_cases[idx +1])
        idx +=2
        delta_P = calculate_delta_P(N, P)
        # Ensure enough decimal places
        print(f"Case #{test_case}: {delta_P}")
        
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code reads the number of test cases, processes each case by calculating the required increase in \(P\), and outputs the result with sufficient precision.
