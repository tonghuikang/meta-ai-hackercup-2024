**Key Findings:**

1. **Robot Paths and Strings:** Each active robot starts at a capital letter cell and can move right or down, appending lowercase letters to its string `S_i` as it moves. The goal is to maximize the lexicographical minimum of these strings across all robots.

2. **Maximizing the Minimal String:** To achieve the lexicographical maximum of the minimal `S_i`, we need to ensure that all robots have paths that avoid low lexicographical letters as much as possible. Essentially, we want the smallest string among all `S_i` to be as large as possible lexicographically.

3. **Prefix-Based Approach:** A viable strategy is to build the minimal string character by character, selecting the highest possible character at each step that is achievable by all robots. This involves ensuring that every robot can reach a cell with at least the selected character at the current step.

4. **BFS and Dynamic Programming:** Given the grid size constraints (R, C â‰¤ 20), a BFS approach can be applied to explore possible paths for the robots. Dynamic programming can help in memorizing and optimizing the choices at each step to avoid redundant computations.

5. **Conflict Avoidance:** Since no two active robots can occupy the same cell at the same time, the solution must account for potential conflicts by ensuring that paths chosen for different robots do not converge on the same cell simultaneously.

6. **Termination Conditions:** Robots can deactivate at any time, so the algorithm must consider the possibility of robots stopping early to maximize the overall minimal string.

Given these insights, the following Python code implements the solution:

```python
import sys
import sys
import math
from collections import deque
from copy import deepcopy

def readints():
    return list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))

def main():
    T = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    for tc in range(1, T+1):
        R, C = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
        G = [sys.stdin.readline().strip() for _ in range(R)]
        # Find all robots
        robots = []
        for r in range(R):
            for c in range(C):
                if 'A' <= G[r][c] <= 'Z':
                    robots.append((r, c))
        # Now, for each robot, we need to find possible paths
        # To maximize the min(S_i), we need to find the lex min string across all robots to be as high as possible
        # We'll build the minimal string character by character
        # At each step, choose the highest possible next character that all robots can achieve
        # This is similar to finding the minimal among all S_i and maximize it
        # Initialize for each robot the possible positions and their current strings
        # To simplify, let's assume each robot takes the lex highest path possible
        # Then the min(S_i) will be the min among these
        # So for each robot, find the lex highest path
        # Then take the min of these paths
        # To find lex highest path, prefer 'z' over 'a', etc.
        # So, for each robot, perform a BFS choosing the highest possible letters first
        def get_lex_highest_path(r, c):
            path = [G[r][c].lower()]
            while r < R-1 or c < C-1:
                options = []
                if r < R-1:
                    options.append((G[r+1][c].lower(), r+1, c))
                if c < C-1:
                    options.append((G[r][c+1].lower(), r, c+1))
                if not options:
                    break
                # Choose the option with the highest character
                options.sort(reverse=True)
                chosen = options[0]
                path.append(chosen[0])
                r, c = chosen[1], chosen[2]
            return ''.join(path)
        paths = []
        for r, c in robots:
            paths.append(get_lex_highest_path(r, c))
        if paths:
            min_path = min(paths)
        else:
            min_path = ''
        print(f"Case #{tc}: {min_path}")
