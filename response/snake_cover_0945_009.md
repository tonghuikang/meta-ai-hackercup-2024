When approaching this problem, several key observations and strategies are essential to devise an efficient solution:

1. **Snake Representation:**
   - Given the large possible size of the snake (`N` up to \(10^9\)), it's impractical to track each cell individually. Instead, we can represent the snake's position by tracking the head's movements and maintaining a record of the tail's position relative to the head.

2. **Direction Management:**
   - The snake can face four directions: North, East, South, or West. We can represent these directions using vectors (e.g., East as `(1, 0)`, North as `(0, 1)`, etc.) and update the current direction based on the turn instructions (`L`, `R`, `S`).

3. **Tracking Movement and Positions:**
   - As the snake moves, the head advances in the current direction, and the tail follows the path the head has taken `N` steps ago. To efficiently track the minimum and maximum coordinates (to compute the area of the bounding rectangle), we can maintain cumulative positions and track the active window of the last `N` positions.

4. **Sliding Window Technique:**
   - Implement a sliding window of the last `N` positions to determine the current positions of all cells. However, since `N` can be very large, we need a more optimized approach. Instead, we can observe that the snake's body essentially follows the head's path with a delay and use this property to calculate the bounding rectangle without storing all positions.

5. **Efficient Area Calculation:**
   - For each move, determine how the head's movement affects the bounding rectangle. Since the snake can overlap itself, it's possible that the area might decrease or increase based on the direction changes. The goal is to find the minimum area during each move, which can often be determined by analyzing the head's path and its relation to the previous directions.

6. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - Given the large output size, all calculations should be performed modulo \(1{,}000{,}000{,}007\) to prevent integer overflow and to conform to the problem's requirements.

By leveraging these strategies, we can compute the desired sum of minimum areas efficiently, even with the problem's stringent constraints.

        # However N can be up to 1e9, which is too large
        # Observation: The snake is infinitely long compared to the movement steps
        # So the initial snake is in a straight line, and only after N steps does it start turning
        # Given time constraints, we will assume that N >= total steps, so the tail does not move
        # But since X_i can be up to 1e9 and M up to 1e6, total steps can be up to 1e15
        # Hence, we need a better approach
        
        # Alternative approach:
        # The area A(t) depends on the current head position and the positions of the tail
