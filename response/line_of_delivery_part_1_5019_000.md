**Key Findings:**

1. **Energy and Order Relationship:** Since no two stones have the same energy and each stone transfers its remaining energy upon collision, processing stones in decreasing order of energy ensures that higher-energy stones are placed first, potentially affecting the placement of lower-energy stones.

2. **Efficient Position Tracking:** To efficiently track the positions of stationary stones and detect potential collisions, it's effective to use a data structure that maintains sorted positions, such as a balanced binary search tree (BST). This allows quick insertion and searching for the nearest stone to the left of a given position.

3. **Determining Final Positions:**
   - For each stone, calculate its intended final position without collisions as `position = E_i`.
   - Check if there's an existing stone at or before this position. If a collision occurs, adjust the moving stone's final position to just before the collision point.
   - This can be efficiently handled by finding the nearest existing stone to the left of the intended position and ensuring no overlap.

4. **Handling Multiple Test Cases:** Given the constraints on the number of test cases and the total number of stones, the solution must efficiently reset and manage data structures between test cases to avoid performance issues.

5. **Final Calculation:** After determining the final positions of all stones, compute the distance of each stone from the goal position `G`. Finally, select the stone with the minimal distance to `G`. In case of ties, choose the stone with the smallest index.
