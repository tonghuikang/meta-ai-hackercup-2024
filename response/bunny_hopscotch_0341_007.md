To solve this problem, we can use a binary search approach to identify the K-th smallest score efficiently. Here's a breakdown of the key steps involved:

1. **Binary Search on Possible Scores:** Since the score ranges from 0 to the maximum dimension of the grid, we'll perform a binary search within this range to find the smallest score such that the number of valid hops with scores less than or equal to this value is at least K.

2. **Calculating Total Ordered Pairs (`T(S)`):** For a given score `S`, calculate the total number of ordered pairs of burrows where the hop score is less than or equal to `S`. This involves calculating the number of possible hops within a square of side `2S+1` around each burrow, adjusting for edge cases where the square goes beyond the grid boundaries.

3. **Calculating Ordered Pairs with the Same Owner (`T_same(S)`):** For each bunny owner, determine the number of ordered pairs of their own burrows that have a score less than or equal to `S`. This requires iterating through the positions of each owner's burrows and counting valid pairs efficiently.

4. **Determining Valid Hops:** The number of valid hops where the owners are different is obtained by subtracting `T_same(S)` from `T(S)`. If this number is greater than or equal to `K`, we adjust our binary search accordingly to narrow down the possible score.

5. **Optimizing Input Handling:** Given the large size of the input, it's crucial to read and process the input efficiently using Python's `sys.stdin.read()` method.

Here's the Python code implementing this approach:

```python
import sys
import sys
import bisect

def main():
    import sys
    import threading

    def solve():
        import sys
        from collections import defaultdict

        data = sys.stdin.read().split()
        idx = 0
        T = int(data[idx]); idx +=1
        for test_case in range(1, T+1):
            R = int(data[idx]); C = int(data[idx+1]); K = int(data[idx+2]); idx +=3
            grid = []
            owner_positions = defaultdict(list)
            for r in range(R):
                row = list(map(int, data[idx:idx+C]))
                idx += C
                grid.append(row)
                for c in range(C):
                    owner_positions[row[c]].append( (r, c) )
            # Binary search over possible S
            left = 0
            right = max(R, C)
            def compute_T(S):
                # Compute sum_{dx=-S}^S (R - |dx|) = R + 2*sum_{d=1}^{min(S, R-1)} (R - d)
                min_S_R = min(S, R-1)
                sum_R = R + 2 * (min_S_R * R - (min_S_R * (min_S_R +1))//2)
                min_S_C = min(S, C-1)
                sum_C = C + 2 * (min_S_C * C - (min_S_C * (min_S_C +1))//2)
                return sum_R * sum_C
            def compute_T_same(S):
                total = 0
                for owner, positions in owner_positions.items():
                    k = len(positions)
                    if k <2:
                        continue
                    # Sort positions by row, then column
                    positions_sorted = sorted(positions)
                    # Use a sliding window approach
                    # For ordered pairs, we need to count all (u,v) where max(|i2-i1|, |j2 -j1|) <=S
                    # Since ordered, we can for each u, count number of v with v != u and within S
                    # To optimize, we can sort by row and use sliding window on rows, then within rows use binary search on columns
                    # Alternatively, use a 2D grid for the owner's positions and for each position, count number within S
                    # Given constraints, we can use brute force for small k
                    if k <= 1000:
                        cnt = 0
                        for u in positions:
