**Key Findings:**

1. **Problem Structure and Constraints:**
   - We have a total of \( n = N + M \) sushi pieces, where \( N \leq 50 \) and \( M \leq 5 \).
   - Each sushi piece has a distinct tastiness value, with nigiri values \( A_i \leq 100 \) and sashimi values \( B_i \geq 101 \).
   - The goal is to count the number of permutations of these \( n \) pieces such that the "unevenness score" \( S(P) \) does not exceed \( L \).

2. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Approach:**
   - **State Representation:**
     - **Position:** Current position in the permutation.
     - **Used Sashimi Mask:** A bitmask representing which sashimi pieces have been placed.
     - **Last Piece:** The tastiness value of the last placed sushi piece.
     - **Accumulated Unevenness:** The total unevenness score accumulated so far.
   - **Transitions:**
     - At each step, decide whether to place a nigiri or a sashimi, considering unused pieces.
     - Update the unevenness score based on the absolute difference between the current piece and the last piece.
     - Ensure that the accumulated unevenness does not exceed \( L \).
   - **Optimizations:**
     - **Memoization:** To avoid redundant calculations, memoize states based on the used sashimi mask and the last piece.
     - **Pruning:** If the accumulated unevenness exceeds \( L \), prune that path.
     - **Ordering:** Since \( M \) is small, we can efficiently manage the placement of sashimi pieces.

3. **Handling Large \( L \) Values:**
   - Given that \( L \) can be up to \( 10^9 \), it's impractical to track all possible unevenness sums directly.
   - Observing that placing sashimi (with \( B_i \geq 101 \)) between nigiri (with \( A_i \leq 100 \)) introduces large differences, we can strategically place sashimi at the ends or in positions that minimize the unevenness.
   - This reduces the number of feasible permutations that satisfy \( S(P) \leq L \).

4. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - Since the number of valid permutations can be very large, all counts should be computed modulo \( 1{,}000{,}000{,}007 \).

**Python Code:**

```python
import sys
import threading

def main():
    import sys
    import math
    sys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    T = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    for test_case in range(1, T+1):
        N, M, L = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
        A = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
        B = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
        all_sushi = A + B
        n = N + M
        # Assign indices
        nigiri = A
        sashimi = B
        # Precompute differences
        # Since A_i <=100 and B_i >=101, differences between A and A are small, B and B are also small (since B_i are distinct but >=101, their differences are arbitrary)
        # Differences between A and B are >=1
        from functools import lru_cache

        # To reduce state, sort all sushi and assign IDs
        sushi = sorted(all_sushi)
        id_map = {v:i for i,v in enumerate(sushi)}
        # Now, all A are first since they <=100, then B
        # Create type array: 0 for nigiri, 1 for sashimi
        types = [0]*N + [1]*M
        # Separate sorted A and sorted B
        sorted_A = sorted(A)
        sorted_B = sorted(B)
        # DP[pos][mask][last]: number of ways to arrange up to pos, with sashimi mask, last piece index
        # But with N=50, M=5, pos=55, mask=32, last=55, it's manageable

                count = 1
            else:
                count = 1
            mask = 0
            if types[i]==1:
                mask |= (1 << (i - N))
            dp_prev[(mask, i)] = 1
        # Iterate over positions

            for key, cnt in dp_prev.items():
                mask, last = key

                for i in range(n):
                    if types[i]==0:
                        # Check if it's used: since nigiri are all distinct and used as per permutation, we need to track used nigiri
                        # But with N=50, we cannot track all used nigiri in state. So alternative: assume permutations, and place unused
                        # However, it's not feasible. Alternative idea: order the sushi and place each exactly once.
                        # So better to precompute which sushi are used based on position and mask
                        # At position pos, total used are pos, so number of used sashimi is count of bits set in mask
                        # Number of used nigiri is pos - bits set in mask
                        # So which nigiri are unused? All not placed yet. But tracking their identities is complex.
                        # Alternative idea: Since A and B are sorted, and A are first, we can treat nigiri as identical in terms of placement
                        # But they are distinct, so it's problematic.
                        # Given time constraints, we might need to limit N and M differently.
