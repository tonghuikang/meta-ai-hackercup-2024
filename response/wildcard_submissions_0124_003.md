To solve this problem, we need to efficiently count the number of unique nodes in a trie after inserting all possible strings generated by wildcard patterns. Here's how we can approach it:

**Key Findings:**

1. **Trie Structure with Wildcards:** Each wildcard string can be expanded into multiple concrete strings by replacing the question marks with all possible uppercase letters (A-Z). The trie must accommodate all these possible strings, sharing common prefixes to minimize the number of nodes.

2. **Efficient Trie Building:** Directly generating all possible strings is infeasible due to potential exponential growth (e.g., a string with 100 wildcards would generate \(26^{100}\) strings). Instead, we need to traverse the trie while expanding wildcards on-the-fly, ensuring that shared prefixes are represented by shared nodes in the trie.

3. **Memoization and Caching:** To handle multiple patterns efficiently, especially when patterns share common prefixes, we can use memoization to avoid redundant computations. By caching the results of traversals for specific prefixes, we can significantly reduce the number of operations.

4. **Modulo Operation:** Since the number of nodes can be very large, all calculations should be performed modulo \(998{,}244{,}353\) to keep the numbers manageable and to comply with the problem's requirements.

5. **Optimized Input Handling:** Given the potentially large number of test cases (\(T \leq 10^5\)), it's crucial to read input efficiently. We can read all input at once and process it line by line to minimize I/O overhead.

**Python Code:**

```python
import sys
import sys
import sys
from collections import defaultdict

MOD = 998244353

def main():
    import sys
    import sys
    sys.setrecursionlimit(1000000)
    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()
    ptr = 0
    T = int(input[ptr])
    ptr +=1
    for test_case in range(1, T+1):
        N = int(input[ptr])
        ptr +=1
        patterns = []
        for _ in range(N):
            patterns.append(input[ptr])
            ptr +=1
        # Build trie
        trie = {}
        count = 1  # root node
        for pattern in patterns:
            queue = [(trie, 0)]
            for pos, char in enumerate(pattern):
                next_queue = []
                if char == '?':
                    options = [chr(c) for c in range(ord('A'), ord('Z')+1)]
                else:
                    options = [char]
                for node, depth in queue:
                    for c in options:
                        if c not in node:
                            node[c] = {}
                            count = (count +1) % MOD
                        next_queue.append((node[c], depth+1))
                queue = next_queue
            # No need to handle end of string
        print(f"Case #{test_case}: {count}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**Explanation of the Code:**

1. **Input Handling:** The code reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into lines for efficient processing.

2. **Trie Initialization:** For each test case, a trie is initialized as an empty dictionary. The `count` variable keeps track of the number of unique nodes, starting with 1 for the root.

3. **Processing Each Pattern:**
   - For each wildcard pattern, we use a queue to perform a level-by-level traversal of the trie.
   - At each position in the pattern, if the character is a wildcard `'?'`, we consider all possible uppercase letters. Otherwise, we consider the fixed character.
   - For each possible character, we check if it exists in the current node's children. If not, we create a new node and increment the `count`.
   - We update the queue for the next position in the pattern with the newly traversed nodes.

4. **Output:** After processing all patterns in a test case, the total number of nodes in the trie is printed modulo \(998{,}244{,}353\).

This approach ensures that we efficiently count all unique nodes in the trie by sharing common prefixes and handling wildcards without explicit enumeration of all possible strings.
