**Key Findings:**

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem models a random walk where each day, the weight either increases or decreases by 1 unit with equal probability.
   - There's a constraint that the weight cannot exceed any historical maximum by more than **L** units. If gaining 1 unit would violate this constraint, you must lose 1 unit instead.
   - The goal is to find the expected number of days to reach the target weight **G** from the current weight **W**.

2. **Simplifying the Problem:**
   - Let **d = W - G**, representing the difference between the current weight and the target weight.
   - Two primary cases arise based on the value of **L** relative to **d**:
     - **Case 1:** If **L ≥ d**, the weight can fluctuate within the allowed range without being strictly constrained to decreasing. In this scenario, the expected number of days can be calculated using the formula:  
       \[
       \text{Expected Days} = d \times (2d + 1)
       \]
     - **Case 2:** If **L < d**, the constraint effectively limits upward movements, making the process a straightforward decrement without significant fluctuations. Here, the expected number of days is simply:  
       \[
       \text{Expected Days} = d
       \]

3. **Handling Large Numbers:**
   - Given that **W**, **G**, and **L** can be as large as \(10^{18}\), it's crucial to handle large integer computations efficiently.
   - The final result needs to be computed modulo \(998{,}244{,}353\), ensuring that intermediate calculations remain within manageable bounds.

4. **Implementation Strategy:**
   - For each test case, calculate **d = W - G**.
   - Check if **L ≥ d**:
     - If true, compute the expected days using the formula for **Case 1**.
     - Otherwise, use the formula for **Case 2**.
   - Finally, output the result as **p × q^{-1} mod 998244353**, where **p/q** is the expected number of days in its reduced form. Given that the expected number of days is an integer in both cases, **q = 1**, and thus the result simplifies to **p mod 998244353**.

```python
import sys

MOD = 998244353

def main():
    T = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    for tc in range(1, T+1):
        W, G, L = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
        d = W - G
        if L >= d:
            # Compute d*(2*d +1) mod MOD
            # To handle large d, compute d % MOD first
            d_mod = d % MOD
            two_d_plus_one = (2 * d_mod + 1) % MOD
            expected = (d_mod * two_d_plus_one) % MOD
        else:
            # Expected is d mod MOD
            expected = d % MOD
        print(f"Case #{tc}: {expected}")
