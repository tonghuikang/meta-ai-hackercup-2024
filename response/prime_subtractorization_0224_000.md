**Key Findings:**

To efficiently solve the problem of finding the number of *$N$-subtractorizations*, we can leverage the following observations:

1. **Prime Difference Representation:**
   - A prime number \( p \) can be expressed as the difference of two primes \( q \) and \( r \) (i.e., \( p = q - r \)) where both \( q \) and \( r \) are primes \(\leq N\).
   - For \( p = 2 \):
     - It can only be represented if there's a prime \( r \) such that \( 2 + r \) is also prime and \( 2 + r \leq N \). This typically requires \( N \geq 5 \).
   - For odd primes \( p \geq 3 \):
     - The only possible representation is \( p = (p + 2) - 2 \). Hence, \( p + 2 \) must also be a prime \(\leq N\). This scenario corresponds to *twin primes*.

2. **Counting Strategy:**
   - **Include \( p = 2 \):** If \( N \geq 5 \), \( p = 2 \) can be represented as a difference of two primes.
   - **Count Twin Primes:** Count all primes \( p \) (where \( 3 \leq p \leq N-2 \)) such that \( p + 2 \) is also prime and \(\leq N\).

3. **Implementation Steps:**
   - **Sieve of Eratosthenes:** Precompute all prime numbers up to the maximum \( N \) across all test cases.
   - **Identify Twin Primes:** Using the sieve, identify all twin prime pairs \( (p, p+2) \).
   - **Efficient Counting:** For each test case, if \( N \geq 5 \), count \( p = 2 \) and the number of twin primes \( p \leq N-2 \). Otherwise, the count is \( 0 \).

4. **Optimizations:**
   - Utilize the **NumPy** library for efficient sieve implementation and twin prime identification.
   - Use **binary search** (via `bisect`) to quickly count the number of twin primes \(\leq N-2\) for each test case.

With these strategies, the solution ensures that even for large values of \( N \) (up to \( 10^7 \)) and multiple test cases (up to \( 100 \)), the computation remains efficient.

**Python Code:**

```python
import sys
import numpy as np
import bisect

def main():
    import sys
    import numpy as np
    import bisect

    # Read all input first
    input = sys.stdin.read().split()

    T = int(input[0])
    test_cases = list(map(int, input[1:T+1]))
    if not test_cases:
        test_cases = []
    
    # Find the maximum N to define sieve size
    Nmax = max(test_cases) if test_cases else 0

    if Nmax < 5:
        sieve_size = 5  # Minimal size to cover up to N=5
    else:
        sieve_size = Nmax + 3  # To cover p + 2 up to Nmax +2

    # Initialize sieve: True means prime
    sieve = np.ones(sieve_size, dtype=bool)
    sieve[:2] = False  # 0 and 1 are not primes

    # Sieve of Eratosthenes using NumPy for efficiency
    for p in range(2, int(np.sqrt(Nmax)) + 1):
        if sieve[p]:
            sieve[p*p:Nmax+3:p] = False

    # Identify twin primes: p and p+2 are both primes
    # We start from p=3 to p=Nmax-2
    # twin_primes contains the p's such that (p, p+2) are both primes
    if Nmax >= 3:
        twin_primes_np = np.where(sieve[3:Nmax +1] & sieve[5:Nmax +3])[0]
        twin_primes = twin_primes_np.tolist()
    else:
        twin_primes = []

    # Process each test case
    for idx, N in enumerate(test_cases, 1):
        if N <5:
            count = 0
        else:
            count = 1  # Include p=2
            upper_p = N -2
            # Count the number of twin primes p <= upper_p
            twin_count = bisect.bisect_right(twin_primes, upper_p)
            count += twin_count
        print(f"Case #{idx}: {count}")
