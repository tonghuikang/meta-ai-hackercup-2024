**Key Findings:**

1. **Problem Breakdown:**
   - We need to calculate the number of lattice points (integer coordinates) that lie within both a given triangle and a circle centered at the origin with radius \( R \).
   - Each test case contains multiple triangles, and for each triangle, we must determine whether it is entirely within the circle or intersects the circle.
   - The total number of such lattice points across all triangles must be computed modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

2. **Approach for Fully Inside Triangles:**
   - For triangles entirely inside the circle, we can efficiently compute the number of lattice points using **Pick's Theorem**:
     \[
     \text{Number of lattice points} = I + B
     \]
     where:
     - \( I \) is the number of interior lattice points.
     - \( B \) is the number of boundary lattice points.
   - **Pick's Theorem** states:
     \[
     I = A - \frac{B}{2} + 1
     \]
     where \( A \) is the area of the triangle.
   - To apply Pick's Theorem, we calculate the area using the shoelace formula and determine \( B \) by computing the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the differences in coordinates for each edge.

3. **Approach for Partially Intersecting Triangles:**
   - For triangles intersecting the circle, we need to compute the number of lattice points within the intersection of the triangle and the circle.
   - We perform a **scanline algorithm**:
     - Iterate through each integer \( y \) within the vertical span of the triangle.
     - For each \( y \), determine the range of \( x \) values that lie within both the triangle and the circle.
     - Count the number of integer \( x \) values in this overlapping range.

4. **Efficiency Considerations:**
   - Given the constraints (\( N \) up to \( 10^6 \) and \( R \) up to \( 10^6 \)), it's crucial to ensure that each triangle is processed efficiently.
   - By handling fully inside triangles with Pick's Theorem (constant time per triangle) and partially intersecting triangles with an optimized scanline approach, we maintain overall efficiency.

5. **Implementation Highlights:**
   - Utilized Python's `math.isqrt` for efficient integer square root computations, avoiding floating-point inaccuracies.
   - Carefully handled edge cases in the scanline process, ensuring that lattice points are accurately counted without duplication.
   - Modular arithmetic is applied to keep the final result within the required bounds.
