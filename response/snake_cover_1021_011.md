**Key Findings:**

1. **Path Representation with Segments:**
   - Instead of tracking each individual cell (which is infeasible due to the large possible value of \( N \)), represent the snake's movement as a sequence of directional segments. Each segment consists of a direction and the number of steps taken in that direction.
   
2. **Sliding Window for Last \( N \) Positions:**
   - Since the snake length \( N \) can be very large, utilize a sliding window approach to keep track of the last \( N \) steps taken by the head. This can be efficiently managed by maintaining the total steps and dequeuing segments from the tail when they exceed \( N \).

3. **Efficient Min/Max Tracking:**
   - To compute the area \( A(t) \) of the smallest enclosing rectangle, maintain the minimum and maximum \( x \) and \( y \) coordinates of the snake's current position. As the head moves and the tail follows, update these values accordingly.

4. **Handling Direction Changes:**
   - Manage the current direction of the snake's head, updating it based on the turn instructions ('L', 'R', 'S'). Use directional vectors to facilitate movement computations.

5. **Optimizing for Large Inputs:**
   - Given the high constraints (\( M \) up to \( 10^6 \) and \( X_i \) up to \( 10^9 \)), ensure that the implementation processes movements in bulk wherever possible, avoiding per-step computations.

6. **Modulo Operations:**
   - Since the final sum can be very large, perform modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) operations incrementally to prevent integer overflow and ensure correct results.
