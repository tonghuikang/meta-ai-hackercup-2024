When solving this problem, the key challenge is efficiently determining the final positions of a large number of stones without simulating each movement step-by-step, which would be computationally expensive given the constraints.

**Key Findings:**

1. **Energy Transfer Modeling:** The core mechanic involves a stone transferring its remaining energy to the stone it collides with. This resembles the disjoint set union (DSU) or Union-Find data structure, commonly used in problems like the parking problem where you need to find the next available slot efficiently.

2. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU) Approach:** 
   - **Find Operation:** Implement a `find` function to determine the first available position for a stone. If the desired position is occupied, use the DSU to find the next free position.
   - **Union Operation:** Once a stone is placed, update the parent pointer to the next position to ensure subsequent stones skip occupied positions.

3. **Handling Large Positions:** Given that positions can be as large as \(1,000,000\), using a dictionary to represent the DSU's parent links is more efficient than using large arrays.

4. **Energy Transfer Logic:** When a stone is placed at position \(p\) but the position is already occupied, the current stone takes over the position, and the existing stone is recursively moved to a new position based on the remaining energy.

5. **Final Position Determination:** After placing all stones, iterate through the occupied positions to determine which stone is closest to the goal \(G\). In case of ties, the stone with the lower index is chosen.

The following Python code implements this approach efficiently, ensuring that even with large inputs, the solution remains performant.
