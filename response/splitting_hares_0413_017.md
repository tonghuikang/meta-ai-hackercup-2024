**Key Findings:**

1. **Grouping by Color:** Start by grouping the rabbits based on their assigned shirt colors. Each group must contain at least two rabbits as per the problem constraints.

2. **Handling Known Weights:**
   - For each color group, identify rabbits with known weights.
   - Calculate the current minimum and maximum weights in the group to determine the initial value of \( F(c) \).

3. **Assigning Missing Weights:**
   - For groups with missing weights, aim to assign the smallest possible weights that maintain the uniqueness and are as close as possible to existing weights in the group to minimize \( F(c) \).
   - Keep track of all assigned weights to ensure no duplicates are introduced.

4. **Validation:**
   - After assigning weights, verify that all weights are unique and within the specified range [1, 10,000].
   - Ensure that the assignment indeed minimizes the sum of \( F(c) \) across all color groups.
   - If any condition fails, the assignment is invalid.

5. **Efficiency Considerations:**
   - Given the constraints (\( T \leq 10^5 \) and \( N \leq 300 \)), the solution must be optimized for time and space.
   - Utilize efficient data structures like dictionaries and sets to manage groupings and assigned weights.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - Handle scenarios where all weights are known or all are missing.
   - Ensure that no color group violates the minimum size requirement after assignment.

The Python code below implements these findings to determine the feasibility of weight assignments and provides an appropriate assignment when possible.
