**Key Findings:**

1. **Trie Construction with Wildcards:**
   - Each wildcard string can represent multiple strings by replacing '?' with any uppercase letter.
   - When inserting such strings into a trie, '?' causes branching into all 26 possible characters, creating multiple paths.

2. **Efficient Trie Implementation:**
   - To handle multiple test cases efficiently, use a fast trie implementation, avoiding class-based structures.
   - Represent trie nodes using lists where each node has an array of 26 children (one for each uppercase letter).

3. **Per Test Case Processing:**
   - For each test case, initialize a new trie with only the root node.
   - Iterate through each wildcard string, and for each character:
     - If it's a fixed character, proceed to or create the corresponding child node.
     - If it's a '?', iterate through all 26 possible children.
   - Keep track of the total number of nodes created during insertion.

4. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Given the high number of test cases (up to \(10^5\)), ensure that the trie operations are optimized for speed.
   - Utilize iterative approaches and pre-allocated data structures to minimize overhead.

5. **Modulo Operation:**
   - Since the number of nodes can be large, perform all counts modulo \(998{,}244{,}353\) to prevent integer overflow and meet the problem's requirements.
