**Key Findings:**

1. **Problem Reduction:** The task is to determine the minimum number of ants that need to move so that all ants lie on a single straight line. This equivalent to finding the maximum number of colinear points (`s_max`) among the given points and calculating `M = N - s_max`.

2. **Challenges with Large N:** Given the constraints where \( N \) can be up to 1,000,000 per test case and the total sum across test cases is up to 4,000,000, an exact solution with a time complexity of \( O(N^2) \) (which iterates through all possible point pairs) is infeasible.

3. **Approximate Solution with Random Sampling:**
   - **Random Sampling of Points:** To circumvent the high computational cost, we adopt a randomized approach. By randomly sampling a subset of points, we can probabilistically identify lines that contain a significant number of points from the dataset.
   - **Line Identification:** For each sampled point, we compute the slopes to a set number of other randomly selected points. By hashing these slope values, we can identify lines that are likely to have many points lying on them.
   - **Counting Colinear Points:** Once a candidate line is identified, we iterate through all points to count how many lie on this line. To handle large data efficiently, care is taken to represent slopes as reduced fractions and to leverage hashing for quick lookups.
   
4. **Probability Considerations:** The number of samples and iterations is chosen to balance accuracy and computational feasibility. While the approach does not guarantee finding the absolute maximum number of colinear points, it provides an answer within the acceptable range defined by the problem (between \( M \) and \( 2*M \)).

5. **Implementation Optimizations:**
   - **Slope Representation:** Slopes are represented as reduced fractions to ensure that identical slopes are recognized correctly despite potential floating-point inaccuracies.
   - **Efficient Iteration:** By limiting the number of samples and optimizing the inner loops, the solution manages to handle up to 4,000,000 points within reasonable execution time.
