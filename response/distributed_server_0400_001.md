To solve this problem, we aim to find the lexicographically maximum possible value of the minimal string `S_i` obtained by the robots after they collect snacks and deactivate. The challenge lies in coordinating the robots' paths to maximize their strings while avoiding collisions.

Here's a summary of the approach:

1. **Compute Lex Max Paths Individually**: For each robot, calculate their lexicographically maximum possible `S_i` by moving right or down from their starting position.

2. **Order Robots by Lex Max `S_i`**: Sort the robots in decreasing order of their lex max `S_i`. This way, we prioritize maximizing the strings of robots who can achieve higher `S_i`.

3. **Schedule Robots Sequentially**: For each robot, starting from the one with the highest lex max `S_i`, find a path that avoids conflicts with already scheduled robots.

4. **Avoid Collisions**: While finding paths for each robot, ensure that no two robots occupy the same cell at the same time. If a collision would occur, the current robot must adjust its path, potentially resulting in a lexicographically smaller `S_i`.

5. **Update Occupied Positions**: As we schedule each robot, we keep track of occupied positions at each time step to avoid conflicts for subsequent robots.

6. **Determine the Minimal `S_i`**: After scheduling all robots, the minimal `S_i` among all robots is our answer.

Key findings and considerations:

- **Dynamic Programming (DP)**: We use DP to compute the lex max `S_i` for each cell, which helps in finding the best possible path for each robot under the constraints.
- **Conflict Resolution**: By scheduling robots in order of their potential `S_i`, we ensure that conflicts are resolved in favor of robots with higher lexicographical strings.
- **Feasibility with Constraints**: The grid size and number of robots are small enough to allow for this DP approach without exceeding time constraints.
- **State Pruning**: To optimize, we prune states where a cell at a specific time has already been reached with a better `S_i`.

Here is the Python code implementing the above approach:
