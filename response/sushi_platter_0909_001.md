To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of permutations of the combined sushi pieces (nigiri and sashimi) such that the total unevenness score doesn't exceed the limit \(L\).

**Key Findings:**

1. **Constraints Analysis:**
   - \(N\) can be up to 50, and \(M\) up to 5, so the total number of pieces \(n = N + M\) can be up to 55.
   - The number of all possible permutations of \(n\) items is \(n!\), which is infeasible to compute directly for \(n=55\).

2. **Observations:**
   - Sashimi pieces have significantly higher tastiness values compared to nigiri.
   - The unevenness score increases significantly when transitioning between nigiri and sashimi due to the large tastiness difference.
   - Minimizing the transitions between nigiri and sashimi can help in keeping the unevenness score low.

3. **Approach:**
   - Since the large differences occur at the boundaries between nigiri and sashimi, the minimal unevenness scores occur when we group all nigiri together and all sashimi together.
   - We consider two possible arrangements:
     - All nigiri followed by all sashimi.
     - All sashimi followed by all nigiri.
   - For each arrangement, we calculate the minimal unevenness score by sorting the nigiri and sashimi within their groups (since sorted order minimizes the adjacent differences).
   - We then check if the total unevenness score for each arrangement is within the limit \(L\).
   - The number of permutations for each arrangement is \(N! \times M!\) (since each group can be permuted independently).
   - If only one arrangement is valid (unevenness \(\leq L\)), the total number of acceptable permutations is \(N! \times M!\).
   - If both arrangements are valid, the total acceptable permutations are \(2 \times N! \times M!\).

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If neither arrangement has an unevenness score within \(L\), the answer is \(0\).
   - We are not considering permutations where nigiri and sashimi are interleaved because the unevenness score would exceed \(L\) due to large tastiness differences.

    T = int(sys.stdin.readline())

    for case_num in range(1, T+1):

        A = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
        B = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
        N_fact = math.factorial(N)
        M_fact = math.factorial(M)

        A_sorted = sorted(A)
        B_sorted = sorted(B)

        # Calculate minimal unevenness for nigiri and sashimi when sorted
        S_nigiri = sum(abs(A_sorted[i+1] - A_sorted[i]) for i in range(N-1))
        S_sashimi = sum(abs(B_sorted[i+1] - B_sorted[i]) for i in range(M-1))

        # Option 1: Nigiri first, then sashimi
        if N > 0 and M > 0:
            diff_ns = abs(A_sorted[-1] - B_sorted[0])
        elif N > 0:
            diff_ns = 0
        elif M > 0:
            diff_ns = 0
        else:
            diff_ns = 0
        S_total_ns = S_nigiri + diff_ns + S_sashimi

        # Option 2: Sashimi first, then nigiri
        if N > 0 and M > 0:
            diff_sn = abs(B_sorted[-1] - A_sorted[0])
        elif N > 0:
            diff_sn = 0
        elif M > 0:
            diff_sn = 0
        else:
            diff_sn = 0
        S_total_sn = S_sashimi + diff_sn + S_nigiri

        count = 0
        if S_total_ns <= L:
            count = (N_fact * M_fact) % MOD
        if S_total_sn <= L:
            count = (count + (N_fact * M_fact)) % MOD
        # If both sequences are acceptable, we have counted twice
        if S_total_ns <= L and S_total_sn <= L:
            # Both arrangements are acceptable
            count = (N_fact * M_fact * 2) % MOD

        print(f'Case #{case_num}: {count % MOD}')
