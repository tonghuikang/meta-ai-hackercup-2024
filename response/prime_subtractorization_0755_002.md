### Key Findings

To solve the problem of finding the number of *N-subtractorizations* for a given \( N \), we employ the following approach:

1. **Prime Sieve Construction**: 
   - Utilize the **Sieve of Eratosthenes** to efficiently generate all prime numbers up to the maximum possible \( N \) (i.e., \( 10^7 \)).
   - Implement the sieve using **NumPy arrays** for optimized performance in Python.

2. **Prime List Extraction**:
   - Extract the list of primes from the sieve for quick access during test case evaluations.

3. **N-Subtractorization Counting**:
   - For each test case with a specific \( N \):
     - Identify all prime numbers \( S \) such that \( S \leq N - 2 \).
     - For each such \( S \), check if there exists at least one prime \( q \) (where \( q \leq N - S \)) such that \( q + S \) is also a prime.
     - This is efficiently done by performing a bitwise AND between the sieve shifted by \( S \) positions and the sieve up to \( N \). If the result is non-zero, it indicates the existence of such a pair \( (q, q + S) \), and \( S \) is counted as a valid *N-subtractorization*.

4. **Optimization Considerations**:
   - By leveraging NumPy's optimized operations and bitwise manipulations, the solution ensures that even with the upper constraint of \( N = 10^7 \) and \( T = 100 \) test cases, the program remains efficient and executes within acceptable time limits.
