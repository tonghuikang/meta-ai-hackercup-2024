To solve this problem efficiently, especially given the large grid sizes and multiple test cases, the following key findings and strategies are essential:

### Key Findings and Strategy:

1. **Binary Search on Possible Scores**:
   - The score for any hop is defined as `max(|i2 - i1|, |j2 - j1|)`. The minimum possible score is `0` (when hopping to the same cell, which is invalid since owners must differ), and the maximum possible score is `max(R, C) - 1`.
   - We can perform a binary search on the possible score values to find the smallest score `S` such that the number of valid hops with scores ≤ `S` is at least `K`.

2. **Counting Valid Hops for a Given Score `S`**:
   - For a specific score `S`, we need to count all ordered pairs of burrows `(a, b)` where:
     - `B_a != B_b` (different owners).
     - `max(|i2 - i1|, |j2 - j1|) ≤ S`.
   - To achieve this efficiently:
     - **Bucketing by Owners**: Group all burrows by their owner. This allows us to quickly identify burrows with the same owner and exclude invalid hops.
     - **Spatial Partitioning**: For each burrow, determine the range of rows and columns that fall within the current score `S`. Using prefix sums or similar techniques can help count the number of burrows within these ranges.
     - **Avoid Double Counting**: Since hops are ordered, ensure that each valid pair is counted correctly without duplication.

3. **Optimizing for Large Grids**:
   - Given that `R` and `C` can be up to `800`, resulting in up to `640,000` burrows, it's crucial to optimize both time and space.
   - Utilize efficient data structures and algorithms, such as:
     - **Prefix Sum Arrays**: To calculate the number of burrows within a specific rectangular region quickly.
     - **Coordinate Compression**: If necessary, to reduce memory usage when dealing with large coordinate ranges.
     - **Parallel Processing**: When possible, handle different parts of the grid or different test cases in parallel to speed up computation.

4. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**:
   - Since there can be up to `50` test cases, ensure that the solution resets or reinitializes necessary data structures between test cases to avoid incorrect results.
   - Preprocessing steps should be efficient and reusable across test cases where applicable.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - Grids with all burrows owned by the same bunny (resulting in zero valid hops).
   - Cases where `K` is exactly the number of valid hops.
   - Minimal grids (e.g., `1x1` or `1x2`) where the number of possible hops is very limited.

By implementing these strategies, the solution can efficiently handle large inputs and multiple test cases within reasonable time and space constraints.
