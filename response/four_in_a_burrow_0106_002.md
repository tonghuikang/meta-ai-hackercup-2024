To solve this problem, we need to determine who must have achieved a four-in-a-row first in the given Connect Four grid. Here's a step-by-step approach to tackle the problem:

### Key Findings:

1. **Grid Representation:**
   - The grid is 6 rows by 7 columns.
   - Rows are numbered from bottom (0) to top (5).
   - Columns are numbered from left (0) to right (6).

2. **Move Order:**
   - Connie (`C`) makes the first move, followed by Forrest (`F`), alternating turns.
   - Each move fills the lowest available cell in the chosen column.

3. **Four-in-a-Row Detection:**
   - We need to detect all possible four-in-a-row sequences for both `C` and `F` players.
   - Sequences can be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal.

4. **Move Number Assignment:**
   - Assign each cell a move number based on its fill order.
   - Within a column, the bottom cell has the earliest move number, ascending upwards.
   - The global move number depends on the order of column fills, which is not predetermined.

5. **Determining the Winner:**
   - For each four-in-a-row sequence, identify the latest move (the highest row index) that completes the sequence.
   - The player who completes their four-in-a-row with the earliest possible move number is considered the winner.
   - If both players have four-in-a-row sequences that could have been achieved simultaneously, the result is ambiguous (`?`).
   - If neither player has a four-in-a-row, the output is `0`.

6. **Handling Multiple Test Cases:**
   - The solution must handle multiple test cases efficiently, ensuring that each grid is processed independently.

### Python Code:

```python
import sys

def read_grid():
    grid = []
    for _ in range(6):
        line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()
        grid.append(list(line))
    return grid

def get_four_in_a_row(grid, player):
    sequences = []
    # Horizontal
    for r in range(6):
        for c in range(4):
            if all(grid[r][c+i] == player for i in range(4)):
                sequences.append([(r, c+i) for i in range(4)])
    # Vertical
    for c in range(7):
        for r in range(3):
            if all(grid[r+i][c] == player for i in range(4)):
                sequences.append([(r+i, c) for i in range(4)])
    # Diagonal /
    for r in range(3):
        for c in range(4):
            if all(grid[r+i][c+i] == player for i in range(4)):
                sequences.append([(r+i, c+i) for i in range(4)])
    # Diagonal \
    for r in range(3):
        for c in range(3,7):
            if all(grid[r+i][c-i] == player for i in range(4)):
                sequences.append([(r+i, c-i) for i in range(4)])
    return sequences

def find_min_move(grid, sequences):
    min_move = float('inf')
    for seq in sequences:
        # The highest cell in the sequence
        highest = max(seq, key=lambda x: x[0])
        r, c = highest
        # Move number is at least the number of cells below +1
        move_num = r + 1  # since rows are 0-indexed
        if move_num < min_move:
            min_move = move_num
    return min_move

def main():
    T = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    for tc in range(1, T+1):
        # Read empty line
        while True:
            line = sys.stdin.readline()
            if line.strip() == '':
                continue
            else:
                break
        # Read grid
        grid = [list(line.strip()) for line in [line] + [sys.stdin.readline().strip() for _ in range(5)]]
        # Find four in a row for C and F
        c_seqs = get_four_in_a_row(grid, 'C')
        f_seqs = get_four_in_a_row(grid, 'F')
        if not c_seqs and not f_seqs:
            result = '0'
        elif c_seqs and not f_seqs:
            result = 'C'
        elif f_seqs and not c_seqs:
            result = 'F'
        else:
            # Both have sequences, determine who could have achieved first
            # Find the minimal move number for C and F
            c_min = find_min_move(grid, c_seqs)
            f_min = find_min_move(grid, f_seqs)
            if c_min < f_min:
                result = 'C'
            elif f_min < c_min:
                result = 'F'
            else:
                result = '?'
        print(f"Case #{tc}: {result}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation:

1. **Reading the Grid:**
   - The `read_grid` function reads 6 lines of input representing the grid.

2. **Detecting Four-in-a-Row:**
   - The `get_four_in_a_row` function checks for all possible four-in-a-row sequences for the given player (`C` or `F`).

3. **Determining the Minimal Move:**
   - The `find_min_move` function finds the earliest move number that could have completed any four-in-a-row sequence for the player.
   - It identifies the highest cell in each sequence (since it's the last to be filled) and calculates its move number based on its row position.

4. **Main Logic:**
   - For each test case, the grid is read, and four-in-a-row sequences are identified for both players.
   - Depending on the presence of these sequences, the winner is determined:
     - If only one player has a four-in-a-row, that player is the winner.
     - If both have, compare their minimal move numbers to decide who won first.
     - If it's ambiguous, output `?`.
     - If no one has a four-in-a-row, output `0`.

This solution efficiently processes each test case by systematically checking for winning sequences and determining the earliest possible win based on the final grid configuration.
