To solve this problem efficiently, we need to simulate the movement of the stones while considering the transfer of energy during collisions. However, simulating each stone's movement step by step would be too slow due to the large constraints. Instead, we can use a stack-based approach to determine the final positions of the stones.

**Key Findings:**

1. **Observation of Stone Movements:**
   - Stones are thrown sequentially from position 0.
   - Stones move forward based on their energy.
   - Stones cannot occupy the same position at the same time.
   - A moving stone can overtake earlier stones if it has sufficient energy.

2. **Stack-Based Algorithm:**
   - Process stones in reverse order (from last to first).
   - Use a stack to keep track of the positions of stones that could block the current stone.
   - For each stone, determine if it can overtake stones ahead based on its energy.
   - Update the position of the current stone accordingly.
   - The stack ensures efficient computation by avoiding unnecessary iterations.

3. **Calculating Distances:**
   - After determining the final positions of all stones, calculate the distance of each stone from the goal position \( G \).
   - In case of ties (stones equally close to the goal), choose the stone with the smallest index.

4. **Handling Constraints:**
   - The algorithm runs in \( O(N) \) time, which is acceptable given the problem constraints.
   - By avoiding per-unit simulations and utilizing the stack, we efficiently handle large inputs.

Here's the Python code implementing the stack-based algorithm:

```python
import sys
import threading

def main():
    import sys
    import math

    sys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)
    T = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    for test_case in range(1, T + 1):
        N_str, G_str = sys.stdin.readline().split()
        N = int(N_str)
        G = int(G_str)
        E = [int(sys.stdin.readline()) for _ in range(N)]
        positions = [0] * N
        stack = []
        for i in range(N - 1, -1, -1):
            E_i = E[i]
            while stack and E_i >= stack[-1] - 1:
                stack.pop()
            if not stack:
                pos = E_i
            else:
                pos = min(E_i, stack[-1] - 1)
            positions[i] = pos
            stack.append(pos)
        min_distance = float('inf')
        min_index = -1
        for i in range(N):
            distance = abs(G - positions[i])
            if distance < min_distance or (distance == min_distance and i + 1 < min_index):
                min_distance = distance
                min_index = i + 1  # Convert to 1-based index
        print(f"Case #{test_case}: {min_index} {min_distance}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    threading.Thread(target=main).start()
