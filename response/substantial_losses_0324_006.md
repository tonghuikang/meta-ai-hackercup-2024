**Key Findings:**

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the expected number of days to reduce weight from \( W \) to \( G \) under certain constraints.
   - Every day, the weight either increases or decreases by 1 unit with equal probability.
   - A strict rule prevents the weight from exceeding any previously achieved weight plus \( L \).

2. **Mathematical Formulation:**
   - Let \( D = W - G \) be the total weight difference to be reduced.
   - The expected number of days to reach \( G \) from \( W \) can be derived as:
     \[
     E = D \times (2L + 1)
     \]
   - This formula holds true regardless of whether \( D \) is less than, equal to, or greater than \( L \).

3. **Modulo Operation:**
   - Given the large constraints (\( W, G, L \leq 10^{18} \)), we compute \( E \mod 998244353 \).
   - Due to the large size, it’s essential to perform modulus operations during multiplication to prevent overflow.

4. **Implementation Steps:**
   - For each test case:
     - Compute \( D = W - G \).
     - Calculate \( E = D \times (2L + 1) \mod 998244353 \).

5. **Handling Large Numbers:**
   - Since \( W \) and \( L \) can be very large, use efficient modulo operations to handle multiplication without overflow.

**Python Code:**

```python
import sys

MOD = 998244353

def mod_mul(a, b, mod):
    return (a % mod) * (b % mod) % mod

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    T=int(data[0])
    for tc in range(1,T+1):
        W=int(data[3*(tc-1)+1])
        G=int(data[3*(tc-1)+2])
        L=int(data[3*(tc-1)+3])
        D = W - G
        if L <0:
            L=0
        two_L_plus_one = (2 * L +1) % MOD
        D_mod = D % MOD
        E = mod_mul(D_mod, two_L_plus_one, MOD)
        print(f"Case #{tc}: {E}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**Explanation of the Code:**

1. **Function `mod_mul`:**
   - Performs modular multiplication to handle large numbers efficiently without overflow.

2. **Main Function:**
   - Reads all input at once for efficiency.
   - Iterates through each test case, computes \( D \), and calculates \( E = D \times (2L + 1) \mod 998244353 \).
   - Prints the result in the required format.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - If \( L \) is negative (though constraints specify \( L \geq 1 \)), it’s treated as 0 to ensure correctness.

This approach ensures that even with large input values, the computation remains efficient and accurate.
