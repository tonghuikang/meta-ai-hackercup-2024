**Key Findings:**

- The problem requires finding the expected number of days to reach a target weight \( G \) from an initial weight \( W \), given a constraint \( L \).
- Each day, the weight changes by \( +1 \) or \( -1 \) with equal probability, unless increasing weight would exceed the dynamic maximum weight, which is \( \text{current minimum weight} + L \).
- The minimum weight only decreases when the weight decreases.
- Under the given conditions, the expected time to reach the target weight is given by the formula:
  
  \[
  \text{Expected Time} = (W - G) \times (2L + 1)
  \]
  
- This formula is consistent with the sample inputs and outputs provided in the problem.
- Since \( W \), \( G \), and \( L \) can be very large (up to \( 10^{18} \)), we need to perform computations with big integers and compute the final result modulo \( 998{,}244{,}353 \).
- The expected number of days is an integer, so when expressing it as a fraction \( p/q \) in lowest terms, \( q = 1 \), and \( p \) is the expected time. Thus, \( p \times q^{-1} \mod 998{,}244{,}353 = p \mod 998{,}244{,}353 \).

```python
# Read input from standard input and write output to standard output

T = int(input())
M = 998244353

for case_num in range(1, T + 1):
    W_str, G_str, L_str = input().split()
    W = int(W_str)
    G = int(G_str)
    L = int(L_str)

    D = W - G
    N = 2 * L + 1

    D_mod = D % M
    N_mod = N % M

    ExpectedTimeMod = (D_mod * N_mod) % M

    print(f'Case #{case_num}: {ExpectedTimeMod}')
