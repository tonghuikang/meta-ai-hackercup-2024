**Key Findings:**

To solve the problem, the following approach can be taken:

1. **Understanding the Objective:**
   - The goal is to maximize the lexicographically smallest string among all robots' snack collections.
   - This requires determining a common string `s` such that every robot has a path where its collected string `S_i` is at least `s`.

2. **Greedy Character-by-Character Construction:**
   - Start building the string `s` one character at a time.
   - In each iteration, select the highest possible character (`'z'` to `'a'`) that can be appended to `s` while ensuring that every robot can follow a path that makes its `S_i` at least `s + c`.

3. **Path Feasibility for Robots:**
   - For each robot, check if there's a valid path that allows the robot to append the chosen character.
   - This involves performing a BFS for each robot to ensure that it can reach a cell containing the required character without conflicting with other robots.

4. **Conflict Management:**
   - Ensure that no two robots occupy the same cell at the same time during their movement.
   - This is managed by keeping track of occupied cells at each time step.

5. **Efficient Implementation:**
   - Due to the constraints (grid size up to 20x20 and a reasonable number of robots), a BFS-based approach with pruning is feasible.
   - Memoization is used to optimize path checks for robots.

6. **Result Compilation:**
   - The string `s` is built iteratively until no further characters can be appended without violating the constraints.
   - The final string `s` is the desired lexicographically maximum value of `min(S_i)`.
